# About Weekly Robotics

Weekly Robotics is a series of handpicked resources about Robotics that is delivered weekly in a form of a robotics newsletter. There is no fixed set of criteria how the resources are selected, however a great care is taken in making sure that the resources have a reasonable level of technical depth - allowing the reader to have a good idea about the presented concepts or providing supporting resources that extend the topic.
