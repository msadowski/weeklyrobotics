# About Weekly Robotics

Weekly Robotics is a newsletter created by Mat Sadowski ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mateuszsadowski/), [Blog](https://msadowski.github.io/)), a robotics consultant by day and a robotics news addict by night. In the newsletter I try to pick a handful of interesting links about robotics (both professional and DIY), research, space technologies and many more.

If you'd like to follow the newsletter then you can either visit the website, use your RSS reader of choice or subscribe via e-mail using the subscription form at the top of the website. We are using Mailchimp for e-mail newsletter delivery and we will never share your e-mail with anybody.

## Get in touch

If you have any suggestions about Weekly Robotics or would like us to include your project in one of the issues please feel free to [contact Mat](mailto:contact@weeklyrobotics.com).
