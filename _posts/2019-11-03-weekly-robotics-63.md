![Issue {{page.idx}}](/img/headers/{{page.idx}}.jpg "Issue {{page.idx}}")

> I work on this newsletter in phases. Phase 1 is going through my news feed and shortlisting the articles I found interesting (currently I use bookmarks for that). The second phase is going through the shortlisted webpages and selecting the ones that will appear in the next issue. This week I broke the record with 38 webpages shortlisted (!). The third phase is selecting the 7 top features. If a page doesn't make it to the top I either add it to the next issue or I delete it. I was thinking that in the future I might add the links that 'did not make it' to the newsletter.

1) Saildrone USV Completes First Atlantic Crossing East to West.
<br>[Saildrone](https://www.saildrone.com/news/first-autonomous-vehicle-atlantic-crossing-east-west?mc_cid=b9320225f2&mc_eid=065323ba53)<br>
INFO: I've covered the first Atlantic crossing by Saildrone in the [issue #28](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-28). This time Saildrone was the first Unmanned Surface Vehicle to pass the Atlantic East to West and thus becoming the first unmanned vessel to make a roundtrip of the Atlantic (it traveled the first leg of the journey in August this year).

2) The Spacex Starship Is a Very Big Deal.
<br>[caseyhandmer.wordpress.com](https://caseyhandmer.wordpress.com/2019/10/29/the-spacex-starship-is-a-very-big-deal/)<br>
INFO: This is a very thorough blog post about how SpaceX BFR/Starship is a game changer in space vehicles. In the blog post you will also find a video in which Elon Musk explains how Starship will perform landing on earth.

3) Build Your Own Thrust Vectored Rockets For Vertical Landings Like SpaceX.
<br>[Make](https://makezine.com/2019/10/25/build-your-own-thrust-vectored-rockets-for-vertical-landings-like-spacex/)<br>
INFO: While we are at SpaceX rockets: in the above article Joe Barnard shares his experience building reusable rockets.

4) Can Autonomous Wheels Disrupt Indoor Mobility?
<br>[The Robot Report](https://www.therobotreport.com/autonomous-wheel-disrupt-indoor-mobility/)<br>
INFO: In this article Olivier Mitchell introduces wheel.me, an Oslo based company working on autonomous wheels (they were hirigin back in [May](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-38)). I really like the idea and I can't wait to see this technology applied somewhere. Apart from technology the curious thing I found about this article is the wheel.me business model, which is described as indoor-mobility-as-a-service. I'm really curious to see how [Robots-as-a-service](https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/30/the-rise-of-robots-as-a-service/) evolves in the future. Will try to keep you posted!

5) Helping Autonomous Vehicles See around Corners.
<br>[MIT](https://news.mit.edu/2019/helping-autonomous-vehicles-see-around-corners-1028)<br>
INFO: MIT Researchers are working on a camera that uses computer vision techniques to detect and classify changes of shadows on the ground. According to the article the system was able to detect a car turning around a pillar 0.72 seconds faster than a LiDAR in the controlled environment the experiments were done in.

6) It’s Official: Bionicopter Is the Biggest Flying Robotic Insect.
<br>[Automation World](https://www.automationworld.com/home/news/13743002/its-official-bionicopter-is-the-biggest-flying-robotic-insect)<br>
INFO: The robot has a wingspan of 63 cm (24.8 in), length of 44 cm (17.3 in) and weighs only 175 g (6.2 oz), which is impressive given that the robot has 13 degrees of freedom. You can learn more about the project and see the video demonstrating the robot in action on [Festo Bionicopter page](https://www.festo.com/group/en/cms/10224.htm).

7) Publication of the Week - Risley Prism Scanner: Application Note (PDF).
<br>[ThorLabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/images/tabimages/Risley_Prism_Scanner_App_Note.pdf)<br>
INFO: Risley Prism Scanner uses two rotating prisms to create a circular scanning pattern using a single laser scanner. This application note by [ThorLabs](https://www.thorlabs.com/) discusses the principle of this technology and shows how to build a scanner like this.
