> The most clicked last week was [the Soft Bank's robot simulator](https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/blog/qibullet) with 14.5% opens.

1) Virtual DonkeyCar (and Other Cars, Too) Race.
<br>[Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/events/269918414/)<br>
INFO: Folks at DonkeyCar are hosting a virtual deep-learning fueled competition this week. If you look at the Meetup page you will find [a link](https://youtu.be/FM1q7QJ1JRA?t=370) to a YouTube video showing the simulator in action.

2) Hello (Subterranean) World!
<br>[GitHub](https://github.com/osrf/subt_hello_world/blob/master/posts/01_hello_world.md)<br>
INFO: Michael from [Open Robotics](https://www.openrobotics.org/) had shared a tutorial how to get started with [SubT virtual challenge](https://subtchallenge.world/). Time for some cave exploration!

3) SubT Challenge Urban Circuit Overview.
<br>[ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/subt-challenge-urban-circuit-overview/13635)<br>
INFO: While we are on the topic of SubT challenge and Open Robotics: this post by Katherine Scott is the best write up on the teams and robots taking part in the challenge I've seen to date. I like how Katherine provides lots of background information and covers the highlights of each of the presented platforms.

4) iRobot Education Launches to Train Future Roboticists.
<br>[The Robot Report](https://www.therobotreport.com/irobot-education-launches-to-train-next-gen-roboticists/)<br>
INFO: "iRobot has created a new division, iRobot Education, to house all of its education products and services under one roof. iRobot Education includes the Root coding robot, Create 2, a new iRobot Coding platform, and the company’s STEM outreach program."

5) Debugging a Live Saturn V.
<br>[zamiang.com](https://www.zamiang.com/post/debugging-a-live-saturn-v)<br>
INFO: Not very much robotics related but this might spark your imagination: imagine approaching a 6.5M pounds (2,950,000 kg) steel barrel carrying 203,400 gallons (770,000 liters) of explosives that is ready to be launched into space just to replace one component. I can see why safety helmets wouldn't feel like they improve your safety in any way.

6) How Boston Dynamics' Spot Robot Works!
<br>[YouTube (Adam Savage’s Tested)](https://youtu.be/R-PdPtqw78k)<br>
INFO: In this episode of Tested Adam Savage goes over some of the functions of the Boston Dynamic's Spot quadruped robots. What I like about videos like this is seeing the system's from the user's perspective and finding out about all the features the robots are shipped with.

7) Access High-Resolution Ocean Data Sets.
<br>[Saildrone](https://www.saildrone.com/news/access-high-resolution-ocean-data-sets)<br>
INFO: Yet another example of using robots for good. At [data.saildrone.com](https://data.saildrone.com/) you will find datasets captured by these unmanned surface vehicles. Information about Saildrone was previously shared in this newsletter in the issue [#63](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-63) and [#28](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-28).
