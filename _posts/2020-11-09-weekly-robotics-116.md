The FreeLoader is a low cost, desktop size, open source, universal testing machine, designed for inexpensive high-throughput material testing. A freeLoader can apply tensile and compression loads of 5 kN with +/- 1.8 N accuracy, and at rates ranging from 2 mm/min to 30 mm/min. Each freeLoader can perform two simultaneous tests and costs under US$4,000.

[YouTube (cmurobotics)](https://youtu.be/jTio_MPQRYc)

This seminar presents an overview of how autonomous driving technologies have been integrated with Uber cars. Jeff Schneider, former Engineer Lead at Uber, shows live examples of numerous tricky situations that autonomous vehicles have to go through. He also tells about all the different architectures developed during his career ranging from classic motion planners to more recent neural network architectures using deep learning. This is a fun video to watch and get to know a bit more about the whole process of creating an autonomous car.
