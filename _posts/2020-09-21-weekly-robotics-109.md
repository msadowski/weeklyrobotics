In this video, you will see a servo based bipedal robot having some very good CoG control. I highly recommend going through DrGuero2001 channel for some more interesting videos of robots balancing (I liked [this one](https://youtu.be/P5j619mdesM) showing the robot on a tightrope).

This is not your usual Weekly Robotics entry but I think the issue is so important that it's worth highlighting it. In this unusual Hackaday post, Bob Baddeley shares his experience on dealing with depression in the days of Pandemic. Take care of yourself and if you want to grab a virtual coffee with someone then feel free to [send me an e-mail](mailto:mat@weeklyrobotics.com).

#### GITAI Sending Autonomous Robot to Space Station

[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/space-robots/gitai-autonomous-robot-iss)

GITAI ([WR #32](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-32), [WR #106](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-106)) is going to space, this time instead of telepresence focusing more on autonomy. Looking forward to seeing how everything works out on ISS!

#### Zipline Partners With Walmart on Commercial Drone Delivery

{:.post-source}
[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/drones/zipline-walmart-drone-delivery?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+IeeeSpectrum+(IEEE+Spectrum))

If you've never heard of Zipline then check out [this 10 minute video](https://youtu.be/jEbRVNxL44c) that explains how the company operates in Rwanda. I'm not a fan of drone deliveries mostly due to noise pollution, a small hope is that the fixed-wing is way more quieter than a multirotor but as Evan Ackerman mentions in the article it might be quite challenging to drop a package with a parachute exactly where you want it.

#### Publication of the Week - Design of a Low-Cost Open-Source Underwater Glider (2018)

{:.post-source}
[engrXiv](https://engrxiv.org/kvqmh/)

This paper describes a design of a <$1k open-source underwater glider. This robot is built from 7 subassemblies, containing many 3D printed parts. The glider can change buoyancy by taking in the water into surgical syringes using a piston system. To learn more about the project [this Hackaday page](https://hackaday.io/project/20458-osug-open-source-underwater-glider) contains a video and a link to the project repository.
