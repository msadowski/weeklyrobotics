> [Last week](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-69) I've mentioned that I couldn't find any video from the AlphaPilot AI drone race. Fortunately Martin Nievas had my back on twitter and shared [this tweet](https://twitter.com/mlnievas/status/1206755724979851265) that features a bit longer video that gives you an idea how the drone flew.

> I would like to wish a Merry Christmas / Happy Holidays to all of you reading this. If you'd like to get into christmas mood with some themed video then check out some from: [ETH Zurich Autonomous Systems Lab](https://youtu.be/f8impUfin3Q), [ETH Zurich Robotics Systems Lab](https://youtu.be/A3HkGzbZEQM), [FZI Living Lab](https://youtu.be/4vvnGaqz7rs), [ALTAIR Robotics Lab](https://youtu.be/0D_cB5vnLzU), [Northern Robotics Laboratory](https://youtu.be/uNiGKETYOjQ), [LAI Robotics](https://youtu.be/GH3_ZU9eowU), [Technical University of Munich](https://youtu.be/S1uqCfLVSS8), [Rozum Robotics](https://youtu.be/nvBhRyTHZqc). In hindsight I should have probably made a whole newsletter issue with these videos... Maybe next year! I bet I missed plenty of videos, feel free to share some with me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/WeeklyRobotics) and I'll happily reshare them.

1) Game of Drones at NeurIPS 2019: Simulation-based Drone-Racing Competition Built on AirSim.
<br>[Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/game-of-drones-at-neurips-2019-simulation-based-drone-racing-competition-built-on-airsim/)<br>
INFO: Coming back to the topic of drone racing for a bit: "at NeurIPS the AirSim research team is working together with Stanford University and University of Zurich to further democratize drone-racing research by hosting a simulation-based competition, Game of Drones. We are hosting the competition on Microsoft AirSim, our Unreal Engine-based simulator for multirotors. The competition focuses on trajectory planning and control, computer vision, and opponent drone avoidance". AirSim is one of the many projects I featured in [awesome-WR](https://github.com/msadowski/awesome-weekly-robotics) - a database highlighting some of the interesting robotics I covered in this robotics newsletter.

2) First Drive Test of NASA’s Mars 2020 Rover.
<br>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/hrF5YwR-j24)<br>
INFO: NASA's MARS rover was tested earlier this week. I find it fascinating how many engineers are involved in these tests. I wonder how much data a test like this generates?

3) Aeva Unveils Lidar on a Chip.
<br>[Spectrum IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/sensors/lidar-on-a-chip-at-last)<br>
INFO: From time to time I hear about LiDARS on chips (or solid-state LiDARS), usually without much detail. According to the article Aeva's solution should cost <500$ when mass produced and will offer a 120° horizontal and 30° vertical field of view and a range of up to 300 meters.

4) Digit v2: Dynamic Obstacle Avoidance.
<br>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/FVZM9pkMLSw)<br>
INFO: Agility Robotics engineers are invading Digit's personal space causing it to move away. I think the captions add a lot to this video.

5) Mimic.
<br>[GitHub](https://github.com/AutodeskRoboticsLab/Mimic)<br>
INFO: Mimic is an open-source Maya plugin for controlling Industrial Robots developed by Autodesk Robotics Lab. For more information see the [Mimic website](https://www.mimicformaya.com/) - it seem to have a good amount of tutorials available. If you would like to see this plugin in action then [this one year old video](https://youtu.be/QU85tV_WRuk) should give you a good idea how it works.

6) Sarcos Demonstrates Powered Exosuit That Gives Workers Super Strength.
<br>[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/sarcos-guardian-xo-powered-exoskeleton)<br>
INFO: "If you were to ask the question, What does 30 years and $300 million look like, you're going to see it downstairs". This IEEE Spectrum article covers Guardian XO, a 24 DoF, a full body exoskeleton allowing the user to weight up to 90 kilograms (200 pounds). I find the company's business model interesting as they seem to offer a Robotics-as-a-service type of solution.

7) Publication of the Week - Multi-Functional Soft-Bodied Jellyfish-Like Swimming (2019).
<br>[Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10549-7)<br>
INFO: I stumbled upon this article thanks to Reddit user SDSS-J1106-1939 and [his post](https://www.reddit.com/r/sciences/comments/ecpdsj/jellyfishinspired_robot/) on /r/Robotics. In this work Researchers an untethered jellyfish inspired soft robot to study jellyfish locomotion. I highly recommend watching [the video showing the robot in action](https://youtu.be/94HKM9SpRBc) - when you do pay attention to the scale of these robots.
