> The most clicked link last week was [IEEE article on how Boston Dynamics taught its robots to dance](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/how-boston-dynamics-taught-its-robots-to-dance) with 16.8% opens. You seem to enjoy this topic, so this week you can get even more in-depth look into the process of choreographing BD robots!

#### CES 2021 Is All About the Robots

A short article by Lance Ulanoff, showing some of the robots presented at CES. Big thanks [Artur](https://github.com/ArturSkowronski) for the tip! One other project that caught my attention when going through CES 2021 was the [Reachy VR teleoperation](https://www.engadget.com/reachy-the-robot-can-now-be-controlled-via-vr-200508703.html).

These clever robots by [Bionic Hive](http://www.bionichive.com/), that can change from being ground robots to being able to attach themselves to the rack and move vertically and horizontally, have been doing rounds [around Twitter](https://twitter.com/ChiefRobot/status/1349103827119710208). This video is a slightly longer presentation of the SqUID capabilities.

#### Robots Made of Ice Could Build and Repair Themselves on Other Planets

[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/space-robots/robots-made-of-ice-could-build-and-repair-themselves-on-other-planets)

These robots look like something straight out of [Seveneves](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22816087-seveneves). In this research, the whole robot was constructed by the Researchers but the hope is that at one point these robots will be able to handle all the ice processing themselves.

[YouTube (Adam Savageâ€™s Tested)](https://youtu.be/2SpNjBI1lu0)

If you still don't have enough of the [dancing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fn3KWM1kuAw) in this episode of Tested Adam Savage and Norman Chan are looking at the Choreographer's software that Boston Dynamics used to script the movements of the robots.

A fascinating album of pictures showing 3000 Sols on Mars through the lenses of Curiosity (and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter?). I love the quality of some of these pictures!

#### Publication of the Week - SwarmRail: A Novel Overhead Robot System for Indoor Transport and Mobile Manipulation (2020) (PDF)

{:.post-source}
[DLR](https://elib.dlr.de/133813/1/ICRA_2020_Swarmrail_Final.pdf)

[Rodrigo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-lopes-catto/): Warehouses and manufacturers have been using robots to get more efficiency and speed in their lines. This paper proposes a new concept using omnidirectional robots in overhead L-shaped rails. This architecture frees the ground space that can be used for other purposes. Each mobile robot can carry a transport box, tools, and even a manipulator, allowing the system to be highly flexible, dynamic, and modular. This could be a good solution for factories that need constant changes on their plant floor.

### Weekly Robotics 2 Years Ago

[Issue 21](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-21)

The highlights on what we were looking at 2 years ago are:

[Autonomous Driving Cookbook by Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft/AutonomousDrivingCookbook) - sadly, the book is still in preview, more than 3 years after the initial commit, and more than 2 years since the most recent one. [Bill Gates meets robots at Harvard University Lab](https://www.gatesnotes.com/About-Bill-Gates/My-visit-to-a-Harvard-robotics-lab)
NASA's plan for an asteroid redirection test - to be launched in July this year! The latest article about the mission I found on NASA is [here](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/predicting-the-unpredictable-the-dynamics-of-dart-s-dive-into-an-asteroid/)
