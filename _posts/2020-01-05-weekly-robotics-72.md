> Starting from next week I'll be publishing the newsletter on Monday's CET instead of Sundays for at least 5 weeks due to some changes in my schedule, hope you won't mind!

Even though I didn't sum up the 2019 in robotics many others did! The one I particularly liked for robotics related news is the [Robotshop summary](https://www.robotshop.com/community/blog/show/robotics-news-the-top-news-in-the-robotics-field-for-2019). The Robot Report made a list of [companies we've lost in 2019](https://www.therobotreport.com/robotics-companies-we-lost-2019/), that I also found to be a good reminder how difficult robotics business can be.

Some summaries tangent to the newsletter that I've enjoyed are the [Top MIT research stories of 2019](http://news.mit.edu/2020/top-mit-research-stories-of-2019-0103), [2019 Space Station Research in Pictures by NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/2019-space-station-research-in-pictures) and 5 minutes long video of [ESA highlights 2019](http://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Videos/2019/12/ESA_highlights_2019).

1) Hello (Real) World with ROS â€“ Robot Operating System.
<br>[TU Delft](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/hello-real-world-with-ros-robot-operating-systems/)<br>
INFO: In 10 days a free 6 weeks ROS course will start on edX platform. The expected workload is approximately 8-12 hours per week and looking at the curriculum course should cover most of the basic on using ROS with Python.

2) SPHERES.
<br>[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPHERES)<br>
INFO: I learned about SPHERES by reading the article [NASA 2019 Space Station Research in Pictures](https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/2019-space-station-research-in-pictures). Each of these satellites is a polyhedron with a mass of about 4.1 kg and a diameter of 21 cm. They use CO2-based cold-gas thrusters for movement and ultrasonic beacon for localization. According to the linked articles they were predecessors to Astrobee, one of my favourite robots ([#35](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-35), [#39](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-39), [#44](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-44), [#60](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-60)).

3) 2,000 Drones Light up Night Sky in Shanghai to Welcome New Year.

INFO: Have you seen this Shanghai drone display? It looks to me that the swarm control of multiple drones is solved problem.

4) Road-Marking Robot Adds Hard Drive to New A14.
<br>[Cambridge Independent](https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/road-marking-robot-adds-hard-drive-to-new-a14-9095099/)<br>
INFO: It looks like lane pre-marking is a very time consuming and dangerous task. According to the article a line pre-marking robot had been deployed in some of the UK roadworks saving hundreds of hours for both the workers and drivers. The featured robot seems to be [TinyPreMarker](https://tinymobilerobots.com/tinypremarker/) developed by TinyMobileRobots, a Danish robotics company.

5) Atlas - 6DOF 3D Printed Universal Robot.
<br>[Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/168259-atlas-6dof-3d-printed-universal-robot)<br>
INFO: For some reason I'm attracted to the idea of using BLDC motors in robot arms. In this project Damian Lickindorf is using [ODrive](https://odriverobotics.com/) to control two of the axes of the robot arm (the rest of the joints are using stepper motors). The robot is capable of carrying loads of up to 2.5-4.5 kg depending on speed of movement. If you like robot arms then I recommend checking out [the project gallery](https://hackaday.io/project/168259/gallery#f426912e1a2b8b53ef3aee2485acff13). It contains amazing renders and videos of the author testing the robot.

6) The Material Science of Metal 3D Printing.
<br>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/fzBRYsiyxjI)<br>
INFO: This video from Real Engineering discusses the current state of additive manufacturing techniques vs. the traditional manufacturing processes, especially when scale is considered.
