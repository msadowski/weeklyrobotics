> This week I managed to forget my login details to my RSS reader. Resigned I started adding sources from memory and ended up finding lots of interesting blogs and news sites. Thanks to [feedly](https://feedly.com/) support being super helpful and I managed to log back in to my main account. In my book that's an OK (albeit a bit stressful) way to end up with 20+ new sources to look at when doing research for this newsletter.

1) Unpiloted Soyuz Capsule With Humanoid Robot On Board Finally Reaches Space Station.
<br>[Space.com](https://www.space.com/unpiloted-soyuz-ms14-docks-at-space-station.html)<br>
INFO: [Last week](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-53) we mentioned that Soyuz Capsule carrying Skybot F-850 humanoid robot experience issues with docking. You will be glad to hear that the robot made it safely to the ISS and as soon as I hear on some reports about performing experiments with it I'll let you know!

2) CIMON Back on Earth After 14 Months on the ISS.
<br>[DLR](https://www.dlr.de/dlr/en/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-10081/151_read-37427/)<br>
INFO: Some robots need to come down in order for others to go up. CIMON, a robot assistant for astronauts that we covered in [issue #17](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-17) had made it to earth. You can see the robot in action in [this video](https://youtu.be/72sB2YjoiC8).

3) MIT’s Fleet of Autonomous Boats Can Now Shapeshift.
<br>[MIT](http://news.mit.edu/2019/roboats-autonomous-connect-assemble-0829)<br>
INFO: "Roboats" are now able to reassemble into different configurations to form floating platforms in Amsterdam. These boats are intended to be used to construct floating bridges, transporting goods and people and collecting trash.

4) Webots Meets ROS.
<br>[wiki.ros.org](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros)<br>
INFO: Webots, a robot development environment that [went open source](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2019-a-release) at the end of last year (as reported in [WR #19](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-19)) made it to ROS. You can find a tutorial showing example launch files with various robotics platforms on [ROS wiki](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros/Tutorials/Sample%20Simulations).

5) Skid Steer Mows Airport Grass Autonomously.
<br>[Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/28/skid-steer-mows-airport-grass-autonomously/)<br>
INFO: In this post we can learn about an autonomous mower utilizing [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/) to perform runway mowing. You can learn more about the technical details of the project on [author's blog](http://deepsouthrobotics.com/2019/08/23/anatomy-of-a-huge-self-driving-mower/).

6) Nothing Gets In: Waterproof Enclosure Design 101 (and IP68).
<br>[fictiv](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/posts/nothing-gets-in-waterproof-enclosure-design-101-and-ip68)<br>
INFO: I found this article to be quite informative. It covers IP ratings, seals and enclosure design.

7) Publication of the Week - Underactuated Robotics: Algorithms for Walking, Swimming, Flying and Manipulation (2019).
<br>[MIT](http://underactuated.csail.mit.edu/underactuated.html)<br>
INFO: Underactuated Robotics is a course taught by Professor Russ Tedrake at MIT. The above link contains notes on the topics covered in the lectures that are freely available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChfUOAhz7ynELF-s_1LPpWg).

### Sponsored

1) ROS Web Tutorial Part 3 - Web Video Server.
<br>[msadowski.github.io](https://msadowski.github.io/ros-web-tutorial-pt3-web_video_server/)<br>
INFO: I've created the last tutorial in my ROS web tutorial series. In this one I'm exploring web_video_server and how you can use it to stream camera feed over HTTP with ROS. If you'd be interested in some more advanced ROS tutorials feel free to [let me know](mailto:mat@weeklyrobotics.com). If there is enough interest I'll start publishing tutorials regularly.
