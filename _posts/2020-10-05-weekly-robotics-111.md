> Welcome to the 7th issue of Weekly Robotics (sorry, it was my last chance for a binary pun in the next 17 years). What I'm learning the hard way these days is that moving houses always takes longer than anticipated. This is the reason for this issue being very brief, from the next week onwards I should fully return to my usual flow. The most clicked last week was [Microsoft's Computer Vision Recipies](https://github.com/microsoft/computervision-recipes/tree/master/scenarios) with 18.4% opens.

[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.fr/us/explosive-reveal-amazon-warehouse-injuries-report-2020-9)

According to Reveal, Amazon's warehouses where the robots were introduced showed a 50% higher rate of injury than other warehouses between 2016 and 2019. You can see the full report with statistics [here](https://revealnews.org/article/amazon-injury-rates/). According to the Business Insider article, Amazon believes that the data has been misinterpreted.

[GitHub](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Faze4-Robotic-arm)

Faze4 is a small fully 3d printable Open source 6 axis robotic arm. It is functionally and esthetically similar to robotic arms in the industry but is aimed for research, education and anyone interested in making his own robot arm. The project is now featured in the [Awesome Weekly Robotics](https://github.com/msadowski/awesome-weekly-robotics) list.

#### Researchers Develop Versatile Robotic Fabric

{:.post-source}
[Techxplore](https://techxplore.com/news/2020-09-versatile-robotic-fabric.html)

"The lab of Prof. Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio has created a robotic fabric that includes actuation, sensing, and variable stiffness fibers while retaining all the qualities that make fabric so useful—flexibility, breathability, small storage footprint, and low weight. They demonstrated their robotic fabric going from a flat, ordinary fabric to a standing, load-bearing structure. They also showed a wearable robotic tourniquet and a small airplane with stowable/deployable fabric wings. The results are published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences".
