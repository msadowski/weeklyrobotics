0) Weekly Robotics #32 Survey Results.
<br>[WeeklyRobotics](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-32-survey)<br>
INFO: In Weekly Robotics #32 we created a survey that was completed by 66 readers. Thank you! The post above contains the results of the survey with some commentary, plans for the future and current state of the newsletter.

1) BREEZE- Bioinspired Ray for Extreme Environments and Zonal Exploration.
<br>[NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/niac/2019_Phase_I_Phase_II/breeze/)<br>
INFO: BREEZE is a research project by Javid Bayandor from State University of New York that received funding as part of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program. The project will explore developing a flying ray built from inflatable structures with bio-inspired kinematics.

2) Orbital Drive (2017).
<br>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/Z0rGd7UO2Tk)<br>
INFO: This YouTube video by [Skyentific](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcgqJ1blFKqbC2bWGY4Opmg) presents an Orbital Drive a speed reducer for brushless motor with ratio of 35:1. There is a follow up [video](https://youtu.be/k_BYfppPSgg) from the author from two weeks ago in which he tests the Orbital Drive with [ODrive](https://eu.odriverobotics.com/), an open source motor controller.

3) The Age of Robot Farmers.
<br>[The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/15/the-age-of-robot-farmers)<br>
INFO: In this article from The New Yorker John Seabrook describes the current state of the strawberry farm labour market in the US and how robotized strawberry pickers can come to the rescue. We like how this article presents the business case for robots for strawberry picking without overselling it. Another thing we liked is the mentioned 'demo effect' during the picker presentation and how cautious one has to be if the Lidar is off.

4) Hello (Real) World with ROS – Robot Operating System.
<br>[TU Delft](https://online-learning.tudelft.nl/courses/hello-real-world-with-ros-robot-operating-systems/)<br>
INFO: If you are looking to learn ROS you might consider taking a look at this free edX course that covers ROS setup, communication, autonomous navigation, motion planning and object detection.

5) Robots Help Archaeologists to Explore Pre-Incan Ruins in Peru (2018).
<br>[Stanford Engineering](https://engineering.stanford.edu/magazine/article/robots-help-archaeologists-explore-pre-incan-ruins-peru)<br>
INFO: This article (and a featured video) presents how Archaeologists from Stanford Archaeology Center are using robots for ruins exploration. In the video we can see a Vinebot (you can see how to make one in [this tutorial](https://www.vinerobots.org/build-one/pre-formed-vine-robot/)) and a small mobile rover being used in the field.

6) SpaceX Falcon Heavy Sticks Triple Rocket Landing with 1st Commercial Launch.
<br>[Space.com](https://www.space.com/spacex-falcon-heavy-triple-rocket-landing-success.html)<br>
INFO: SpaceX Falcon Heavy had it first operational mission debut on April 11th. The rocket deployed an Arabsat-6A satellite and finished the mission by having the two side boosters land on the ground and the center booster land on the drone ship stationed in the Atlantic Ocean.

7) Publication of the week - Quasi-Direct Drive for Low-Cost Compliant Robotic Manipulation (2019).
<br>[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03815)<br>
INFO: This paper introduces Blue - a force-controlled low-cost 7 DoF robotic arm capable of handling payloads of up to 2 kg (4.4 lb) designed by engineers from Berkeley. The robot is meant to work well in unstructured environments while costing under $5,000 when produced in large volumes. The robot's control system is running on Intel NUC and heavily utilizing [ros_control package](http://wiki.ros.org/ros_control). [The project website](https://berkeleyopenrobotics.github.io/) contains further information about the project, including videos showing the robot performing various tasks and tests performed on the robot.
