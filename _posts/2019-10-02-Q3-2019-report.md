Winter is coming!

[3 months ago](https://weeklyrobotics.com/Q2-2019-report) I started doing these quarterly reports. I found them to be a good way to give myself some perspective on how the newsletter is doing and at the same time I thought that some of the readers might find it interesting too. 

## Email Subscribers

We ended this quarter with 1162 e-mail subscribers, reaching a growth of 14.5% in the past 3 months.

The growth is not as significant as in it was in the last quarter (47%) but I'm still happy it's over 10%!

## Website Traffic

This quarter we had 5.4k users with 7.3k sessions. On this chart you can clearly see when I was on holidays (3 weeks starting from mid-August) - I didn't spend time promoting the newsletter. 

## Time Spent on the Newsletter

I spent 63 hours over the past 3 months working on the newsletter (compared to ~81 hours in the previous quarter). I rarely go below 4 hours spent working on Weekly Robotics in a week but one of these weeks I managed to compile a newsletter in under 2 hours.

## Upgrades and future plans

I didn't do too many upgrades in the past quarter. The only one I can think of is the automation of newsletter numbering - before I had to specify the issue number in 3 places, now it's only one place and I don't need to change image generating script on every issue as it should now pick up the title automatically.

This means that I didn't met my goal described in the last report and didn't set up the self-hosted email delivery platform. I wish I could promise I will finish it in Q4 but things are about to get very busy for me, so no promises.

### Long Term Goals

Here are some of the long term goals that I'm hoping to achieve this calendar year with Weekly Robotics:
* Website redesign - especially looking into the structure of the website menu and maybe adding a landing page (while keeping the newsletter archive intact)
* Finding the first sponsor/contributor for the newsletter
* Starting a discussion group - either some kind of forum or a Slack channel
* Kicking off a secret WR project - you will hear about it when it's ready


Thanks a lot for being part of Weekly Robotics. I hope that you continue enjoying this newsletter! If you have any thoughts on this report don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:contact@weeklyrobotics.com).
