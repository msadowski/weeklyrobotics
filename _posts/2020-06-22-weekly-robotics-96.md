> The most clicked last week was the hoverbike crash in Dubai with 18.0% opens. Unfortunately, since I've posted it it was removed from YouTube. [Here](https://youtu.be/fUImvprq-6M) is a mirror for you.

1) Boston Dynamics' Spot Robot Dog Now Available for $74,500.
<br>[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/industrial-robots/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog-now-available)<br>
INFO: Most probably you've heard the news already. If you were buying Spot instead of a luxury car you might be disappointed as the article quotes Boston Dynamics: "we specifically don’t want people to just be using it at home for fun". I know this is probably quite a small detail but the [user guide](https://www.bostondynamics.com/sites/default/files/inline-files/spot-user-guide-r2.0-va.pdf) is amazingly well designed. Well done!

2) ROS2 Tutorial for Beginners.
<br>[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRE44FoOoKf7NzWwxt3W2taZ7BiWyfhCp)<br>
INFO: A team behind [Bot Builder](https://twitter.com/bot_builder_) had put together a series of video tutorials on ROS2.

3) AR2 / AR3 Open Robotic Arms.
<br>[Annin Robotics](https://www.anninrobotics.com/)<br>
INFO: "The Annin Robotics AR2 and AR3 are free open plan low-cost robots anyone can make themselves. They can be made using aluminum components or you can 3D print the parts yourself".

4) How to Start a Robot Revolution | Part 1 | Breaking the Wheel.
<br>[Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/open-source-stories/how-to-start-a-robot-revolution?sc_cid=7013a000002DUuvAAG)<br>
INFO: Here is the first episode of a documentary series about ROS. In the first episode, we can learn about ROS, PR2 and Willow Garage. You can also get a glimpse of how a standup looks like at Open Robotics.

5) UBR-1 on ROS2 (Part 3).
<br>[Robot & Chisel](https://www.robotandchisel.com/2020/06/16/ubr1-on-ros2/)<br>
INFO: Here is another update from Michael Ferguson on updating his UBR-1 to ROS2. This time the author covers porting openni2_camera driver to ROS2, components (ROS2 replacement for [nodelets](http://wiki.ros.org/nodelet)), parameters, and some RVIZ2 issues. As always the post is very technical and has solid insights on ROS2 debugging.

6) NASA’s Perseverance Mars Rover Sample Caching System.
<br>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/MFyv8mtRPCA)<br>
INFO: "In terms of robots that go into space, the sampling and caching system on the Mars 2020 Mission is the most complicated, most sophisticated thing that we know how to build". In this video we can learn about how many robots are involved in grabbing a sample and how difficult it actually is to pull off. You can learn more about these systems on [NASA's website](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/sample-handling/).

7) SLAM Lectures
<br>[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpUPoM7Rgzi_7YWn14Va2FODh7LzADBSm)<br>
INFO: This YouTube playlist contains a lecture series on SLAM by Claus Brenner. You will find Python files used for the modules on [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0BxwK9_xWk7ewUTFKVEIydTdfMzg). Huge thanks to [Patrick](https://github.com/ptrks) for letting me know about this series!

8) Publication of the Week - RBR 50 Innovation Awards (2020).
<br>[The Robot Report](https://www.therobotreport.com/2020-rbr50-innovation-awards-featured-june-robot-reprort-issue/)<br>
INFO: The Robot Report had published its annual innovation awards.
