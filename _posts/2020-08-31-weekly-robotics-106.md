> Weekly Robotics Slack is slowly getting off the ground. To boost the conversations I've decided to invite the first 15 [newsletter patrons](https://www.patreon.com/WeeklyRobotics) regardless of their tier. Huge thanks to everyone supporting this newsletter - thanks to you I can put more and more time to work on this project! In other news the second [robot teaser](https://youtu.be/bt9zKx5zE9k) is out, this time featuring [Webots](https://www.cyberbotics.com/), an open source robot simulator. The most clicked last week was [the blog post on open problems in robotics](https://scottlocklin.wordpress.com/2020/07/29/open-problems-in-robotics/) with 14.1% opens.

#### Publication of the Week - OpenBot: Turning Smartphones into Robots (2020)

{:.post-source}
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.10631)

Researchers at Intel had created an open source 3D printed robot car frame that you can build yourself for around $50. The base platform uses 4 TT DC motors driven by L298N driver, 3x 18650 Li-ion cells, 2 speed sensors and an Arduino Nano. The maximum speed of the robot is 1.5 m/s. The robot's low level control code runs on the Arduino and the high level control (teleoperation using a joystick or person following) happens onboard an Android smartphone that is connected through a serial interface. For more information about the project check out [OpenRobot.org](https://www.openbot.org/).

You might remember these robots from [this video](https://youtu.be/FBNWM_0waD4) that appeared in the [issue #93](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-93). It looks like the company behind it is ready to take the idea to the new level and start a pilot program. [Project's kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/furrionexobionics/alpha-mech-pilot-program) page had reached more than double of the required funding goal and there are still 31 days of the campaign left. Huge thanks to [Julius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliussust/) and [Charles](https://twitter.com/SeeBQ) for suggesting this video on the Slack channel.

BeetleCam has got new looks as you can see in the teaser above. If you've been following this newsletter for quite a while you might remember BeetleCam from the [issue #49](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-49) that featured [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsEQVWyvI80&feature=youtu.be) showing how the little robot was abused by animals and some of the stunning pictures the robot has taken.

[National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2020/09/the-robot-revolution-has-arrived-feature/)

I really enjoyed this article by David Berreby, who describes some current state of the art in robotics all around the world, mentioning robotics applications in construction, agriculture, commerce and more! Given the length of this article, it's perfect for your afternoon cup of hot chocolate.

#### Outdoor Experiments of the GITAI's G1 Robot（2020.8）

{:.post-source}
[YouTube (GITAI Inc.)](https://youtu.be/yVtqFf0a_Rc)

GITAI seems to have made quite an update since [the last article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/space-robots/gitai-partners-with-jaxa-to-send-telepresence-robots-to-space) I have covered over a [year ago](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-32). The robot operator seems to be using some proper haptic interfaces and a VR headset to operate heavy tools with the robot. I like how this robot can operate a shovel!
