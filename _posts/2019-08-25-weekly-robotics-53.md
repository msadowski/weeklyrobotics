1) ArduRover Boat Uses Tupperware To Float.
<br>[Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/08/18/ardurover-boat-uses-tupperware-to-float/)<br>
INFO: Very interesting project utilizing [ArduRover](ardupilot.org/rover/) (an [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/) project). As you can guess the author of the project used a tupperware as a base platform for a boat. The tupperware used works surprisingly well for it shape and I recommend to watch the 18 minutes video featured in the article.

2) A Cave Is No Place for Humans, So DARPA Is Sending In the Robots.
<br>[Popular Mechanics](https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/research/a28771417/darpa-subterranean-challenge/)<br>
INFO: The first circuit of [DARPA Subterranean Challenge](https://www.subtchallenge.com) (we've mentioned it in the [2nd issue of Weekly Robotics](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-2)) took place from August 15th-22nd. The above post is a good article that sums up the challenge. The winner of this event was the [Explorer team](https://www.subt-explorer.com/) from Carnegie Mellon University and Oregon State University. While on the topic, I highly recommend taking a look at [this IEEE Spectrum article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-hardware/how-teams-are-solving-the-biggest-challenge-at-darpa-subt) showing how the teams approached inevitable communication issues. On [DARPATV YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/DARPAtv/videos) you will find lots of interesting videos about the challenge, including circuit presentation, videos from the participating teams and more.

3) Louise Poubel on the Robot Operating System.
<br>[InfoQ](https://www.infoq.com/podcasts/robotic-operating-system/)<br>
INFO: Big thanks to [Artur](https://github.com/ArturSkowronski) for sending me this podcast episode in which Wesley Reisz interviews Louise Poubel from [Open Robotics](https://www.openrobotics.org/). In the podcast you can learn interesting insights on ROS2, Ignition simulation and robot development. The biggest takeaway for me from this podcast was that in the future Gazebo simulator will be retired in favour of [Ignition Robotics](https://ignitionrobotics.org/home).

4) Russian Humanoid Robot to Pilot Soyuz Capsule to ISS This Week.
<br>[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/space-robots/russian-humanoid-robot-to-pilot-soyuz-capsule-to-iss-this-week)<br>
INFO: This article briefly describes Skybot F-850, a humanoid robot that was launched to ISS onboard Soyuz MS-14 last Thursday. The robot was meant to describe pre-launch preparations and report report flight parameters pos-launch. After arrival to ISS it's meant to be used for a week to perform several tasks that are not public at this point. On Saturday the [Soyuz docking procedure was aborted](https://www.space.com/soyuz-aborts-space-station-docking-ms-14.html) due to rendezvous system malfunction. According to [Roscosmos tweet](https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1165297078987317248) a next automatic docking attempt will take place on Tuesday (27th of August).

5) YAK: 3D Reconstruction in ROS2.
<br>[ROS Industrial](https://rosindustrial.org/news/2019/8/7/yak-3d-reconstruction-in-ros2)<br>
INFO: This article presents the work on Yak (Yet Another KinectFusion), a set of libraries that can be used for volume representation of parts in ROS. The library is licenced under MIT licence and you can find it [on GitHub](https://github.com/ros-industrial/yak).

6) Can Rocket Lab Really Catch a Rocket With a Helicopter?!.
<br>[Everyday Astronaut](https://everydayastronaut.com/rocket-lab-electron-reuse/)<br>
INFO: I found this piece by Tim Dodd to be a very good read about the different methods of rocket recovery and their feasibility. Thanks Tim for a solid lesson on space flight!

7) Publication of the Week - MuSHR: A Low-Cost, Open-Source Robotic Racecar for Education and Research (2019).
<br>[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.08031)<br>
INFO: Via [website](https://mushr.io/): "The Multi-agent System for non-Holonomic Racing (MuSHR) is an open-source robotic hardware and software platform for learning and researching AI in a setting of autonomous vehicles and mobile robotics". The platform is based on off-the shelf R/C car and components and has been built in Personal RoboticsLab  at  the  University  of  Washingtonâ€™s  Paul  G.  Allen  Schoolof Computer Science & Engineering. In the BOM we will find such items as: [IntelRealsense  D435i](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435i/), [YDLIDAR X4](http://www.ydlidar.com/product/X4) (you can find my review of this sensor on my [blog](https://msadowski.github.io/ydlidar-x4-review/)), [VESC](https://vesc-project.com/), [Nvidia  Jetson  Nano](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-nano/) and [Vex Robotics Bumper Switch](https://www.vexrobotics.com/276-2159.html).The full platform built together with an RGBD sensor should cost around $900 (sensorless version should cost about $600). For more information about the project check out [project repository](https://github.com/prl-mushr/mushr).
