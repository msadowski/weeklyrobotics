Welcome to the special edition of Weekly Robotics in which we cover what we think are the most important news and projects of 2018. We hope that you'll enjoy this edition as much as every other issue of Weekly Robotics and we would also like to use this occasion to wish a happy new year to all our readers.

### Open Source Projects

1) NASA's JPL Open Source Rover project.

INFO: This year we came across a fully documented Open Source Rover project from NASA that we mentioned in the [issue #1](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-1). It's also worth mentioning [Sawppy rover](https://github.com/Roger-random/Sawppy_Rover) which is a Rover inspired by the NASA's project that is more cost-effective. 

2) Ikarus electric "rocket".
