> Today's issue is short and to the point. Towards the end of the issue, I will digress from robotics quite a bit to talk about geoscience. The most clicked link last week was [the multirotor with a tensegrity shell](https://hackaday.com/2020/11/05/quadcopter-with-tensegrity-shell-takes-a-beating-and-gets-back-up/) with 13.1% opens.

#### Robotics Simulation in Unity Is as Easy as 1, 2, 3!

{:.post-source}
[Unity](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2020/11/19/robotics-simulation-in-unity-is-as-easy-as-1-2-3/)

Unity is capitalizing on ROS, with a new set of tools for importing URDFs and communicating with ROS based systems. The demonstration in the article is a pick-and-place application, you can find the tutorial on it on [GitHub](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Unity-Robotics-Hub/blob/main/tutorials/pick_and_place/README.md#part-3-naive-pick--place)

Flyability took part in some Research at Chernobyl, resulting in the above video. If you like the idea of using Robotics in irradiated places then you might like [this coverage](https://www.popularmechanics.com/technology/robots/a34480039/spot-robot-dog-chernobyl-radiation/) of Researchers deploying Spot in Chernobyl.

#### Pulling Power from the Sky: The Story of Makani [Feature Film]

{:.post-source}
[YouTube (X, the moonshot factory)](https://youtu.be/qd_hEja6bzE)

[Makani](https://x.company/projects/makani/) was a moonshot project by X, aiming to harness wind power using kites/drones, that was shut down this year. I've only started watching this documentary about Makami project, but I already know that I can fully recommend it. If you enjoy seeing an applied iterative process in Robotics with some drones occasionally crashing then this film is definitely for you.

#### Publication of the Week - HOPPY: An open-source and low-cost kit for dynamic robotics education (2020)

{:.post-source}
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14580)

[Hoppy](https://github.com/RoboDesignLab/HOPPY-Project/) is an open source kit for robot education that dynamically hops around a rotating gantry, developed by researches from the University of Illinois. From the paper, it looks like you can teach students lots of concepts using just this kind of robot.

#### Robotics, Python and Geoscience

Last week I was heavily looking into using USVs for mapping water body depth. When it comes to requirements I wanted to use Python to quickly visualise some of the data. In my quest, I came across two interesting libraries: [pyproj](https://pypi.org/project/pyproj/) for geographic projections and [verde](https://www.fatiando.org/verde/latest/), a package for processing and gridding spatial data. A very useful set of tutorials that really helped me wrap my head around many aspects of geoscience with Python was the [xlines repository](https://github.com/agile-geoscience/xlines) by Agile Geoscience. Iâ€™ve also learned that if you are not 100% sure what you are doing [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) will speed up your development 10x. Thanks to this exercise I can appreciate the amount of work that goes into [projects like these](https://www.mbari.org/at-sea/vehicles/autonomous-underwater-vehicles/seafloor-mapping-auv).
