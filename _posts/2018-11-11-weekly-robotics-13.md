1) ESIM - An Open Event Camera Simulator.
<br>[http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/esim.html](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/esim.html){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: Compared to traditional cameras the event cameras measure the change in pixel intensity, in the form of asynchronous events. [This 30s YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPCZESVfHoQ){:target="_blank"} is a good comparison between the event and traditional cameras. ESIM is an open source event camera simulator allowing simulation of arbitrary camera motion in 3D scenes. The data provided by the sim are: events, standard images, inertial measurements, ground truth information (pose, velocity, depth and optical flow maps).

2) OpenDog quadruped robot video series.

INFO: This playlist by James Bruton contains is a build log of his open source dog robot. It's a great mixture of design, hardware and control systems work. Up to date there are 13 videos in the series.

3) European Robotics Week 2018.
<br>[https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_week/events/index.html](https://www.eu-robotics.net/robotics_week/events/index.html){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: European Robotics Week 2018 will take place from 16 to 25th of November all around Europe. There are over 1000 events planned for those days in the page above you will find an interactive map together with a full list of events. 

4) Inspexel - an open source library for Dynamixel motors.
<br>[https://github.com/gottliebtfreitag/inspexel/](https://github.com/gottliebtfreitag/inspexel/){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: The library support both V1 and V2 Dynamixel protocol, provides automatic motor discovery, supports all baud rates and according to the description in the repository it support all Dynamixel motors that are currently produced. 

5) Understanding quaternions.

INFO: Need a refresher on quaternions? Start here. Or if you'd like more visual explanation then you can find it in [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4EgbgTm0Bg){:target="_blank"}.

6) Pointcloudprinter.
<br>[https://github.com/marian42/pointcloudprinter](https://github.com/marian42/pointcloudprinter){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: If you are creatig point clouds from your UAV or other robotic system you might be interested in the above software that transforms point cloud data into solid meshes for 3D printing.

7) Publication of the week - SFV: Reinforcement Learning of Physical Skills from Videos (2018).
<br>[https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/SFV/index.html](https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/SFV/index.html){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: The work contained in this publication (don't forget to checkout the videos and a blog post) allows simulated characters to learn dynamic movements from videos (hence the name SFV - Skills From Videos). The presented framework takes a video as an input, performs pose estimation, motion reconstruction and finally performs motion imitation in the simulation.
