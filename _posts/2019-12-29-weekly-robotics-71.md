> Last year, right around this time, I run a special edition of the newsletter: [Robotics in 2018](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-2018). Unfortunately, this time I didn't have nowhere enough time to create something of this magnitude. I'll discuss my time constraints in the Q4 report that I should feature in the next newsletter issue but if you'd like a teaser then I would like to take this newsletter to a next level. Hang tight!

1) Anki Assets Acquired by Edtech Startup Digital Dream Labs.
<br>[The Robot Report](https://www.therobotreport.com/anki-assets-acquired-by-digital-dream-labs/)<br>
INFO: Anki was the company behind [Vector](https://anki.com/en-us/vector.html) and [Cozmo](https://anki.com/en-us/cozmo.html) robots that close down last year (I've mentioned that in [issue #37](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-37)). As The Robot Report reports the company's assets were acquired by [Digital Dream Labs](https://www.digitaldreamlabs.com/). I like the idea of Open Source Vector 2.0!

2) UrbanLoco: A Full Sensor Suite Dataset for Mapping and Localization in Urban Scenes.
<br>[advdataset2019](https://advdataset2019.wixsite.com/advlocalization)<br>
INFO: If you would like to play back some robotic car data then this dataset might be for you. One of the car platforms is equipped with a LiDAR (Velodyne HDL 32E), an IMU (Xsens Mti 10), GNSS receiver, Fish-eye Camera (FLIR Grasshopper3) and RTK GNSS/INS integrated navigation system (NovAtel SPAN-CPT) used for ground truth measurement. All data is provided as ROS bags.

3) Apollo Flight Controller 101: Every Console Explained.
<br>[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/12/apollo-flight-controller-101-every-console-explained/)<br>
INFO: In this article Lee Hutchinson goes over the Apollo Mission Control room. I found the article to be very detailed and I love the feel the Eidophor projectors give to the room.

4) Driving Sideways to Move Forward: Stanford Engineers Show How an Autonomous, Drifting DeLorean Can Improve Driver Safety.
<br>[Stanford](https://news.stanford.edu/2019/12/20/autonomous-delorean-drives-sideways-move-forward/)<br>
INFO: I like everything about this project but I think it might be mostly about the car. I really recommend you take a look at the gifs featured in the article. They are stunning!

5) Building All The Robots.
<br>[buildits](https://build-its-inprogress.blogspot.com/2019/11/building-all-robots.html)<br>
INFO: In this blog post Ben Katz makes a photo dump from assembling the [herd of Mini Cheetahs](https://youtu.be/G6fMV1UPzkg).

6) A New Concept of Future Robot Manipulators Will Be Developed from Studying Elephants.
<br>[Sant'Anna News](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/news/new-concept-future-robot-manipulators-will-be-developed-studying-elephants-start-proboscis)<br>
INFO: EU project PROBOSCIS aims at studying the trunk of African bush elephant species and use this information to create bio-inspired robot manipulator. The project's end date is October 2023. I'll try to follow it and keep you posted on any results that I find out about!

7) Dusty Robotics FieldPrinter Automates Building Layout.
<br>[The Robot Report](https://www.therobotreport.com/dusty-robotics-fieldprinter-automates-building-layout/)<br>
INFO: [Building Information Modeling](https://www.dustyrobotics.com/)(BIM) is a process of generating and storing all information on a building in a single place. Field Printer by [DustyRobotics](https://www.dustyrobotics.com/) aims at laying out the building information directly on the build sites. The services will be offered as a robot-as-a-service (RaaS) model.
