> I'm seeing a reduced rate of robotics news in my feed by about ~60%, which is understandable given the current COVID-19 situation in the world. Luckily I have a backlog of information to share with you, so we should be good for the next 2-3 weeks. Stay Safe!
The most clicked last week was [the open source ventilator](https://github.com/jcl5m1/ventilator) with 8.8% opens.

1) The End of Starsky Robotics.
<br>[Medium](https://medium.com/starsky-robotics-blog/the-end-of-starsky-robotics-acb8a6a8a5f5)<br>
INFO: A very insightful article by Stefan Seltz-Axmacher, a CEO of Starsky Robotics, on the difficulties of scaling AI systems, difficulties in raising capital for safety oriented features and eventually having to close the company. I've definitely learned something from this article and I hope the whole team moved on and will keep doing great things!

2) Writing a New Costmap2d Plugin.
<br>[ros-planning](https://ros-planning.github.io/navigation2/tutorials/docs/writing_new_costmap2d_plugin.html)<br>
INFO: In the [last issue](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-83) we've learned about Navigation2 for ROS2 through the paper featured in the publication of the week section. Extending upon that this tutorial shows how to implement a custom costmap plugin for this navigation framework.

3) Open Source Turtle Robot (OSTR).
<br>[Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/id/OSTR/)<br>
INFO: This instructable contains instructions on creating a turtlebot with a marker holder (did you ever play with [logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)?). This project is the most thorough instructable I've ever seen. I was surprised that it even covered odometry calibration.

4) RB-0.
<br>[GitHub](https://github.com/planktonrobo/RB-0)<br>
INFO: While we are on the topic of DIY 3D printed robots: RB-0 is a hobby-sized rover using the same method of suspension as NASA rovers. The brains of this rover is a Jetson Nano and in the repository you will find some ipython notebooks with some additional instructions and source code.

5) Ultra-Precise, Mind-Controlled Prosthetic Hand for Amputees via RPNI Neural Interface.
<br>[YouTube (University of Michigan Engineering)](https://youtu.be/PoKcRtDmKJw)<br>
INFO: Regenerative Peripheral Nerve Interface (RPNI) is a small graft of muscle surgically attached to the end of severed nerves in an amputee's arm in order to amplify the readable signal. I have to say that the results shown in the video seem very promising!

6) A3 Special Report: How Robots and Automation are Fighting Covid-19.
<br>[ria](https://www.robotics.org/content-detail.cfm/Industrial-Robotics-Industry-Insights/How-Robots-and-Automation-are-Supporting-the-Fight-against-Covid-19/content_id/8763)<br>
INFO: In this report Keith Shaw showcases some robotics companies that are aiding in the fight with COVID-19. If you know of anything happening in this space robotics wise that is worth highlighting feel free to let me know!

7) First look under Thwaites Glacier and Kamb Ice Stream.
<br>[Georgia Tech](https://schmidt.eas.gatech.edu/2019-field/firstlookunderthwaitesglacier/)<br>
INFO: "An international team including scientists from Georgia Tech captured new images and first-of-its-kind data from deep beneath an Antarctic glacier, which will help scientists to better understand the impact of one of Antarctica’s fastest changing regions and its impact on future sea level rise". In this mission the team was using [ICEFIN](https://schmidt.eas.gatech.edu/icefin/), a 130 kg submarine capable of getting to a depth of 1 km and covering a range of 3.5 km.

### Job Seekers

[Last week](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-83) I've started this job seekers section for a limited period of time.
