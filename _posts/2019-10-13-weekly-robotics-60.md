> How do you like the stickers shown in the header image of this issue? Let's do a giveaway! The first 20 readers that will send me [an e-mail](mailto:contact+stickers@weeklyrobotics.com) with their postal will get a sticker sent to them free of charge. As soon as your address makes it to the envelope it will be deleted to be never seen again.

1) Imagineering in a Box.
<br>[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/hass-storytelling/imagineering-in-a-box)<br>
INFO: Disney has released a free course on Theme Park design that I found very inspiring and interesting to watch. In Lesson 3 starting with video on Armatures you can have a look into Animatronics at Disney's theme parks. In exercise sections you can even design your own linkage system and actuate it.

2) Drones as Detectives: Surveying Crime Scenes for Evidence.
<br>[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/robotics/drones/drones-as-detectives-surveying-crime-scenes-for-evidence)<br>
INFO: I've heard of a similar idea years ago in the context of using drones and photogrammetry for accident mapping ([this article](https://www.photomodeler.com/pm-applications/pub-safety-forensics/drone-ar-mapping/) from PhotoModeler Technologies will give you an idea what I'm talking about). I'm not sure how useful drones would be on the crime scenes though given that a person can easily take photographs from multiple angles with a handheld camera.   

3) Xaxxon OpenLIDAR Sensor.
<br>[Xaxxon](http://www.xaxxon.com/xaxxon/openlidar#openhardware)<br>
INFO: This project is an open source lidar built using Garmin's Lidar-Lite v3 distance sensor. The maximum range of the assembled LiDAR is 40 meters and it can rotate at 250 RPM (equal to 4.17 Hz full scan rate).

4) Walmartâ€™s Robot Army Has Arrived.
<br>[Fast Company](https://www.fastcompany.com/90395843/walmarts-robot-army-has-arrived)<br>
INFO: How to integrate robots into places full of people while signaling robot's intent? That is one of the problems [Bossa Nova](https://www.bossanova.com/) has to tackle. I found this article to be a good inspiration to think about user interaction in Robotics. 

5) TRI Teaching Robots to Help People in their Homes.
<br>[Toyota Research Institute](https://www.tri.global/news/tri-teaching-robots-to-help-people-in-their-homes-2019-10-3?utm_source=morning_brew)<br>
INFO: I really like the design of this robot - a body of a humanoid robot torso attached to a robot manipulator that is rigidly connected to a mobile robot platform. I recommend watching [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/6IGCIjp2bn4) about this R&D Project. Given that TRI is in the ROS2 Technical Steering Committee what are the chances of this platform running ROS2?

6) Watch Astrobee's First Autonomous Flight on the International Space Station.
<br>[IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/space-robots/watch-astrobees-first-autonomous-flight-on-the-international-space-station)<br>
INFO: One of my all time favourite ROS projects (I covered Astrobee launch in [#35](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-35), a paper on Astrobee Software in [#39](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-39) and the first flight in [#44](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-44)) made its first fully autonomous flight!

7) Publication of the Week - Design, Modeling and Control of a Robot Bat: From Bio-inspiration to Engineering Solutions (2019).
<br>[Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/event/ri-seminar-seth-hutchinson-georgia-tech-professor-kuka-chair-for-robotics-2019-10-04/)<br>
INFO: This is a very interesting seminar on bio-inspired robot design by Seth Hutchinson. I've never realised how many Degrees of Freedom bats have! If you have a one hour of time to invest and you are interested in biologically inspired robots then I recommend watching this lecture. I've definitely learned something today.
