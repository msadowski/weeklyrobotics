> The other day I bought my first consumer robot - Roomba i7 and I'm amazed how well this thing works. The visual slam it uses seems to be quite robust, as long as it has a map of the environment it can localize quite well. I even tried a kidnapped robot test, and as soon as it was able to localize in a feature-rich room it was OK. [Here it is](https://twitter.com/WeeklyRobotics/status/1314831769439436802) getting to know [Ross Robotics](https://www.robosynthesis.com/) dev platform. The other day I published the second issue of monthly robotics for the readers supporting me on Patreon (THANKS!!!) - you can check it out [here](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monthly-robotics-42472839). The most clicked last week was [Michael Ossmann's wheel robot](https://twitter.com/michaelossmann/status/1311543614795730944) with 22.4% opens.

#### Robots Save Us Time — But Do They Make Us Happier?

{:.post-source}
[Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2020/10/robots-save-us-time-but-do-they-make-us-happier)

Since we are focusing on home robots quite a bit in this feature here is a feature that argues that home robots are a double-edged sword. On one hand, it can make you happy by saving you time but on the other hand, if you humanize the robot too much, you might be guilt-tripped every time the robot does your chores.

#### Autoware Does Autonomous Valet Parking!

[Autoware](https://www.autoware.org/post/autoware-does-autonomous-valet-parking)

For a week, a number of people all around the world had worked on Autoware Autonomous Parking. The results are excellent - you can find them in the above article. I love the idea of open-source self-driving cars as long as they are safely used.

#### Open-Source Leg

{:.post-source}
[Michigan-Engineering](https://opensourceleg.com/)

Every now and then I feature robotics prosthetics in the newsletter ([#102](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-102), [#104](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-104), [#84](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-84), [#78](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-78)). But this one is another level - an open-source actuated leg prosthesis aimed at researchers. The part cost of a single unit is around $28.5k, over half of it in machined parts. With this feature, I've added a Bionics section to the [Awesome Weekly Robotics](https://github.com/msadowski/awesome-weekly-robotics#Bionics) - if you know any other open source bionics related projects I should put there don't hesitate to let me know!

This article features a neat build-log video showing how to assemble a scara arm made of 3D printed components and some 3D printer parts. For more information about this project see this [How To Mechatronics article](https://howtomechatronics.com/projects/scara-robot-how-to-build-your-own-arduino-based-robot/).

#### HeliOS

{:.post-source}
[GitHub](https://github.com/MannyPeterson/HeliOS)

HeliOS is a small operating system (the docs say it's something in between RTOS and a task scheduler) that is so tiny that you can even run it on an Arduino Uno directly from the library manager. You can find a work in progress programmer’s guide for this OS [here](https://github.com/MannyPeterson/HeliOS/blob/master/extras/HeliOS_Programmers_Guide.md).

#### Publication of the Week - RI Seminar: Zachary Manchester : The World’s Tiniest Space Program (2020)

{:.post-source}
[YouTube (cmurobotics)](https://youtu.be/BW5kzYVn2To)

How about a satellite that costs less than your mobile phone (yes, the price includes the cost of launch!). I think the abstract sums up this seminar very well:

The aerospace industry has experienced a dramatic shift over the last decade: Flying a spacecraft has gone from something only national governments and large defense contractors could afford to something a small startup can accomplish on a shoestring budget. A virtuous cycle has developed where lower costs have led to more launches and the growth of new markets for space-based data. However, many barriers remain. This talk will focus on driving these trends to their ultimate limit by harnessing advances in electronics, planning, and control to build spacecraft that cost less than a new smartphone and can be deployed in large numbers.
