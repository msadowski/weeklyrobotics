INFO: MIT researchers are experimenting with a drone powered by ionic wind (airflow induced by electrostatic forces). According to the video in the above blog post the aircraft managed to fly over 60 meters (~10 seconds flight) using this method of propulsion.

2) NASA Mars landing stream.

INFO: NASA's InSight lander is scheduled to land on Mars on 26th of November around 3PM EST (9PM CET). The landing commentary will be streamed online. The goal of InSight mission is to study Mars deep interior.

3) OpenCV 4.0 was released.
<br>[https://opencv.org/opencv-4-0-0.html](https://opencv.org/opencv-4-0-0.html){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: After 3.5 years since 3.x release a new major version of OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) has been released. 

4) Dexter - open-source 3D printed robot arm.

INFO: Alphabet is dissolving Schaft, a developer of bipedal robots that Google acquired in 2013. In [this IEEE Spectrum article](https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/humanoids/shaft-demos-new-bipedal-robot-in-japan){:target="_blank"} you can learn about the Bipedal robot that Schaft showcased on a conference in Japan in 2016.

6) Stanford giving robotic hands sense of human touch.
<br>[https://www.therobotreport.com/electronic-glove-robotic-hands-touch/](https://www.therobotreport.com/electronic-glove-robotic-hands-touch/){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: Stanford Engineers developed a sensor capable of measuring intensity and direction of pressure as well as heat. This allow the manipulator to handle such delicate tasks as moving a ping-pong ball or touching a raspberry without squashing it.

7) Remotion - A Motion-Based Capture and Replay Platform of Mobile Device Interaction - (2018).
<br>[https://remotion.cs.brown.edu/](https://remotion.cs.brown.edu/){:target="_blank"}<br>
INFO: Remotion is a set of hardware and software tools to replay mobile phone user interactions with a physical setup that replicates the mobile phone movement.
