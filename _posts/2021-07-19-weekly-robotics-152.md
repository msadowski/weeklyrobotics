#### RPG Visual Odometry Releases

Lately, the [Robotics & Perception Group](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/) had released two interesting projects related to visual odometry. [EVO](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_evo_open) is a pipeline for using event cameras for visual odometry. [SVO](https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_svo_pro_open) is an implementation of Semi-direct Visual Odometry. The results featured in both repositories look great. Each of the repositories features some bagfiles that you can use to reproduce the results from logged data. Both packages are licenced under GPL 3.0.

"OpenAI has disbanded its robotics team after years of research into machines that can learn to perform tasks like solving a Rubik’s Cube. Company cofounder Wojciech Zaremba quietly revealed on a podcast hosted by startup Weights & Biases that OpenAI has shifted its focus to other domains, where data is more readily available".

I don't understand anything from the description or featured text but SOBY seems to be a bipedal-wheeled robot, resembling [Ascento](https://www.ascento.ethz.ch/) a lot when it comes to kinematic linkages. I’m curious to see what will come out of this project.

[Stanford Pupper](https://stanfordstudentrobotics.org/pupper), an open source legged robot just got a lot smaller. As with the original Pupper, according to this article, everything will be open source, so you should be able to build your own should you be on the market for a small robot dog.

In this 5 minute video, Tom Scott is visiting [Ocado](https://www.ocadogroup.com/technology/technology-pioneers) grocery packing warehouse, where thousands of robots work on bagging groceries. Naming this warehouse a 'hive' is spot on.

#### Publication of the Week - Efficient and Reactive Planning for High Speed Robot Air Hockey (2021)

[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.06140)

Air Hockey is by far one of my favorite games. It requires fast and precise movements to predict the trajectory of the puck with an excellent strategy to use the table’s borders in your favor. All of that can be accomplished by, of course, robots. To be more specific, the authors used two Kuka Liwa 14 robot arms and present a novel trajectory optimization that generates a high-speed motion by pushing the arms limits.
