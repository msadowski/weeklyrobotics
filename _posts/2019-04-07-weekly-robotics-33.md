1) Project MORPH.
<br>[Hackaday](https://hackaday.io/project/25730/logs?sort=oldest)<br>
INFO: This build log by Roald Lemmens provides insights into development of MORPH (Modular Open Robotics Platform for Hackers) - a mobile robot driven by two hoverboard motors. The robot frame was built using aluminium profiles and the motors are driven by VESC motor controllers and use AS5047 magnetic encoders for reading wheel position. The robot control code is executed on Intel UP Board and is utilizing ROS. The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/roaldlemmens/morph).

2) microROS.
<br>[microros.github.io/](https://microros.github.io/)<br>
INFO: microROS is a project aiming to support ROS2 implementation on microcontrollers. The project targets boards capable of supporting Nuttx Real-Time Operating System. microROS is being developed as a part of the [Ofera project](http://www.ofera.eu/).

3) 3D Printing and Milling Athena Optic Bench.
<br>[ESA](http://www.esa.int/spaceinimages/Images/2019/04/3D_printing_and_milling_Athena_optic_bench)<br>
INFO: ESA together with Germany’s Fraunhofer Institute for Material and Beam Technology started an exploratory activity on the optic bench. The system uses two industrial robots - one is melting the titanium powder to create 3D structures, while the second one is milling away any imperfections, all while the bench is slowly turning. The role of the optic bench is to align and secure 750 mirror modules used to capture and focus high energy X-rays. The required precision of the overall shape is in few tens of micrometers. The article features [this video](http://www.esa.int/spaceinvideos/Videos/2019/04/3D_printing_titanium_for_ESA_s_Athena) showing the 3D printing in titanium.

4) NASA's Mars Helicopter Completes Flight Tests.
<br>[JPL/NASA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7361)<br>
INFO: Earlier this year NASA completed a flight test of it's helicopter destined for Mars. The helicopter weights 1.8 kg (4 pounds) and was designed to function in temperatures as low as -90°C (-130°F). The flight test were performed in a vacuum chamber prepared to imitate Mars atmosphere. During the trials the vehicle was tested at 5 cm (2 in) hover. The video of the test can be found on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/326662931).

5) The Evolution of an Arduino Project.
<br>[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VarQDTmwLI0)<br>
INFO: This YouTube video shows almost 4 years progress on a DIY ping-pong ball juggling robot. The author considered several approaches for bounce position estimation such as microphones, phototransistors and vision systems.

6) RE2 Robotics Performs Robotic Disaster Clean-up at Tyndall Air Force Base in the Aftermath of Hurricane Michael.
<br>[RE2](http://www.resquared.com/re2-robotics-performs-disaster-cleanup)<br>
INFO: RE2 Robotics helped clean up an Airforce Base using RADR robotic retrofit kit technology implemented on Genie GTH-1256 telehandler. The setup allowed workers to teloperate the GTH-1256 to perform sweeping and debris removal, while maintaining a safe distance.

7) Publication of the week - Keep Rollin' - Whole-Body Motion Control and Planning for Wheeled Quadrupedal Robots (2019).
<br>[arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.03557)<br>
INFO: ETH University Researchers equipped an ANYmal quadruped robot with wheels. This paper shows dynamic locomotion for wheeled quadrupedal robots which combine the mobility of legs with the efficiency of driving. You can see the results of the paper in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/nGLUsyx9Vvc).

### Careers
