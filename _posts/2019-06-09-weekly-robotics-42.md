>> [Two weeks ago](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-40) we promised that the issue 42 will come with some answers to a secretive sub-project we've been working on. The short story is that we are becoming custodians of Robotics content. For a longer version scroll down to the announcement section (or if you really can't wait: go directly to [our curated database](https://weeklyrobotics.com/awesome-wr.html)).

1) Collinear Mecanum Drive ICRA 2019.
<br>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/EG2pka4Bczg)<br>
INFO: This video shows a balancing robot utilizing mecanum wheels that allow it to move sideways. Combining sideways movement with a forward motion produces quite interesting results.

2) Dashing Diademata Delivers Second Generation ROS.
<br>[Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/06/06/dashing-diademata-delivers-second-generation-ros/)<br>
INFO: ROS 2 Dashing Diamenta, has been released. We found the above article to be a great introduction to this long term release (with support guaranteed for the next 2 years). For more information you can head to [ROS discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/ros-2-dashing-diademata-released/9365), where you can find some demonstrators posted in the thread.

3) Open Robotics Meets the Open Road - DECODED Show S3E1.
<br>[YouTube](https://youtu.be/fAUTJa7Nrdc)<br>
INFO: In this episode of The Decoded Show the authors meet Matt Robinson from SwRI to talk about ROS Industrial and showcase some examples utilizing ROS. At BMW we can learn how ROS is used to optimize logistics and some insights on plan alpha - a testing ground for robots that are meant to operate in a manufacturing plant.

4) videoflow.
<br>[GitHub](https://github.com/videoflow/videoflow)<br>
INFO: Videoflow is an open source Python framework that facilitates quick development of complex video analysis applications. You can find a result of an object detection used with this framework in [this YouTube video](https://youtu.be/TYGMllb7fHM). [Here](https://docs.videoflow.dev/) you can find project documentation.

5) TU Delft Scientists Create World’s Smallest Autonomous Racing Drone.
<br>[Innovation Origins](https://innovationorigins.com/tu-delft-scientists-create-worlds-smallest-autonomous-racing-drone/)<br>
INFO: The scientists from MAVLab (last time we've featured their work was back in [issue #6](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-6)) created a 72 gram (2.5 oz) drone capable of flying autonomously on a track using an onboard camera for localization. The drone is capable of flying the track with an average speed of 2 m/s.

6) Tiny Robots Carry Stem Cells Through a Mouse.
<br>[IEEE](https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-human-os/biomedical/devices/magnetically-navigated-microbots-deliver-stem-cells-in-mice)<br>
INFO: Scientists from DGIST-ETH Microrobotics Research Center created a magnetically-actuated robot that successfully carried stem cells through a live mouse. As it is noted in the article a huge challenge for working with such robots in vivo is observing the position of the robot while performing the procedure.

7) Publication of the Week - University Rover Challenge: Tutorials and Team Survey (2018).
<br>[GitHub](https://github.com/danielsnider/ros-rover)<br>
INFO: This repository contains loads of information from Team R3 of Ryerson University in Toronto that took part in the University Rover Challenge in 2017. In the linked repository you will also find a chapter from the book Robot Operating System (ROS): The Complete Reference (Volume 3), Studies in Computational Intelligence that was prepared by the members of the team. From the published chapter we can learn about the system design, comparison of solutions chosen by various teams. The chapter also includes plenty of tutorials on various aspects of robot development with ROS.

8) Orbital Index Newsletter.
<br>[Orbital Index](https://orbitalindex.com/)<br>
INFO: Orbital Index is a newsletter with curated links related to space technologies. We've been subscribed to Orbital Index for two months now and we are thoroughly enjoying it and we are sure that the readers who are also into space technology will love it too!

### Careers

1) [Liquid Robotics](http://jobs.jobvite.com/careers/liquid-robotics-inc/jobs?__jvst=Career+Site) (Sunnyvale, CA, US) - Various Positions.
<br>
INFO: Liquid Robotics creates autonomous wave-powered ocean vehicles- remote sensor platforms that are used in oceanography, oil and gas, defense and communications. The platform doesn't require fuel for propulsion, and can operate for up to a year in the ocean which creates unique engineering challenges for durability, fault tolerance and remote sensing.

2) [BotsAndUs](https://www.indeed.co.uk/viewjob?t=robotics+quality+assurance+engineer&jk=96ce6925ceeb657e&_ga=2.17336058.2127306831.1558877207-1564327470.1558877207) (London, UK) - Robotics Quality Assurance Engineer.
<br>
INFO: BotsAndUs are building a social robotics platform to help organisations interact with and learn about their customers and guests. We have developed our own platform to support this goal, and we’re looking for a new team member who can help us scale up our technical expertise and development resources.

3) [Sevendof](https://www.finn.no/job/fulltime/ad.html?finnkode=148735141) (Trondheim, Norway) - Embedded Software Engineer.
<br>
INFO: Sevendof is a startup in Trondheim focused on building the drone infrastructure of the future. We seek to make drones available as a service to businesses for purposes such as inspection, mapping, and search and rescue. Sevendof will operate a network of long-range drones which are stationed in the field, enabling missions to be carried out automatically.
