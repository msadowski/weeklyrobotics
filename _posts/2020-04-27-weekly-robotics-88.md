> I have just finished listening to an audiobook [Creativity, Inc.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077903-creativity-inc), a piece about Pixar and creativity in business. Even though it's not directly related to robotics I found it inspiring and will definitely look back on it as I'm growing my company. I'd especially recommend this book to managers in companies of all sizes. It has been a while since we had what I call a "full issue" containing the core of the newsletter, a publication of the week, careers section, an announcement and even a (sort of) sponsored post. The most clicked last week was [Adam Savage's video on how Spot works](https://youtu.be/R-PdPtqw78k) with 13.3% opens.

1) You've Never Seen the Robot Joint Like This One!
<br>[YouTube (Skyentific)](https://youtu.be/utDagouxM5U)<br>
INFO: If you have read [issue #62](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-62) chance is that you've actually seen a robot joint based on a pulley system before. As usual with Skyentific videos I've thoroughly enjoyed the explanation of the principles behind the design and the demonstration.

2) New Scavenger Technology Allows Robots to 'Eat' Metal for Energy.
<br>[Science Daily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/04/200421134420.htm)<br>
INFO: Researchers from University of Pennsylvania's School of Engineering and Applied Science are working on "metal-air scavenger" - a concept that's bridging the gap between batteries and harvesters (for example solar panels). In this project the robot is carrying a cathode, below which a slab of hydrogel is used as an electrolyte and the metal surface the robot is touching is the anode. [Here](https://youtu.be/4Rg2GELb7MI) is the video showing the robot in action where the researchers talk about their invention.

3) What Networks Will Co-Evolve With AI and Robotics?
<br>[Rodney Brooks](https://rodneybrooks.com/what-networks-will-co-evolve-with-ai-and-robotics/)<br>
INFO: An interesting take from Rodney Brooks on what networks (think roads, railway, telephone, cloud computing) could be built because of the current pandemic.

4) April 2020: AWS Robomaker Virtual Meetup.
<br>[YouTube (Object Computing)](https://youtu.be/J7fBQBIqTf8)<br>
INFO: Here is a video recording of the Object Computing virtual meetup on AWS Robomaker that I saw being announced at [ROS Discourse](https://discourse.ros.org/t/aws-robmaker-online-demo/13570).

5) Mithi's Hexapod Robot Simulator.
<br>[GitHub](https://github.com/mithi/hexapod-robot-simulator)<br>
INFO: Here is something interesting: a web based hexapod simulator with forward/inverse kinematics. You can access the working simulator [here](https://hexapod-robot-simulator.herokuapp.com/).

6) Astronautenassistent CIMON-2 Meistert Einstand auf der ISS.
<br>[YouTube (DLR)](https://youtu.be/6UeaZ6GYzX0)<br>
INFO: He is back! CIMON, a free flying robot assistant, seems to be back in the ISS. If you don't speak german - don't be discouraged by the title, everything in the video is in English. Compared to the [video](https://youtu.be/72sB2YjoiC8) I shared in the [issue #54](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-54) the position control seems way better! Looks like

7) Publication of the Week - The Canadian Planetary Emulation Terrain Energy-Aware Rover Navigation Dataset (2020).
<br>[Sage Journals](https://journals.sagepub.com/eprint/2FW9PZRWZ87QHMXURSRP/full)<br>
INFO: This paper and the [dataset](http://www.starslab.ca/enav-planetary-dataset/) will be interesting for anyone looking into creating planetary rovers or testing localization algorithms in uneven terrain. The described dataset contains information from 6 runs with an average distance of 200 meters captured on a Clearpath Husky skid-steered robot. The data you will find in the set contains information from an omnidirectional stereo camera, a monocular camera, IMU, a GPS receiver, wheel encoders, Drive power monitors and pyranometer (used for measuring solar irradiance).

1) 360 Camera for Industrial Inspection with ROS and Robosynthesis Robots.
<br>[msadowski.github.io](https://msadowski.github.io/robosynthesis-3d-camera/)<br>
INFO: Here is something I've enjoyed working on recently: creating a 360 camera module using ROS and [rviz_textured_sphere](https://github.com/UTNuclearRoboticsPublic/rviz_textured_sphere) package. Thought you might enjoy this!
