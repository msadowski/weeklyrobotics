{:.post-entry-title}
[Faze4](https://github.com/PCrnjak/Faze4-Robotic-arm)

Faze4 is a small, fully 3d printable Open source 6 axis robotic arm. It is functionally and esthetically similar to robotic arms in industry but is aimed for research, education and anyone interested in making his own robot arm. You can see the arm in action [here](https://youtu.be/OHw6_l_8Tnk).

----

{:.post-entry-title}
[WireViz](https://github.com/formatc1702/WireViz)

WireViz is a tool for easily documenting cables, wiring harnesses and connector pinouts. It takes plain text, YAML-formatted files as input and produces beautiful graphical output (SVG, PNG, ...) thanks to GraphViz. It handles automatic BOM (Bill of Materials) creation and has a lot of extra features.

{:.post-entry-title}
[Open Dynamic Robot Initiative](https://open-dynamic-robot-initiative.github.io/)

An Open Torque-Controlled Modular Robot Architecture for Legged Locomotion Research. The goal of the project is to develop an actuator that can be reused for making various robotic platforms that you can find in the [project repository](https://github.com/open-dynamic-robot-initiative/open_robot_actuator_hardware)

----

{:.post-entry-title}
[Open Source Robotic Leg](https://opensourceleg.com/)

An open-source actuated leg prosthesis aimed at researchers. The part cost of a single unit is around $28.5k, over half of it in machined parts.

{:.post-entry-title}
[Debugging a live Saturn V](https://www.zamiang.com/post/debugging-a-live-saturn-v)

Imagine approaching a 6.5M pounds (2,950,000 kg) steel barrel carrying 203,400 gallons (770,000 litres) of explosives that is ready to be launched into space just to replace one component. I can see why safety helmets wouldn’t feel like they improve your safety in any way!

{:.post-entry-title}
[Don’t Fear the Robot](https://nautil.us/issue/84/outbreak/dont-fear-the-robot)

A very thoughtful and well-written piece by Joe Jones, who developed Roomba (or DustPuppy). I’ve really liked the explanation of how difficult odometry was to pull off 20 years ago and how it would add $1k cost to the platform and I found the “three principles the team followed while developing Roomba” very refreshing.

{:.post-entry-title}
[So you want to build an embedded Linux system?](https://jaycarlson.net/embedded-linux/)

Jay is very thorough when explaining why you should/shouldn’t use a processor instead of a microcontroller. I think this post might be relevant for anyone looking into using embedded Linux in their projects. I bet you will also like Jay’s attitude: “Continue working on your projects, but never be afraid to roll up your sleeves and commit to some quality practice time!”.

{:.post-entry-title}
[Gears](https://ciechanow.ski/gears/)

If you are reading this newsletter chances are you already have a good knowledge of mechanics but I would still recommend checking out this blog post by Bartosz Ciechanowski. What I especially like about this piece are the interactive animations and a clear design of the website.

[The Making of TF8 a Reaction-Force Series Elastic Actuator Powered Knee and Ankle Prosthesis](https://youtu.be/-a7PJ0MHmBQ)

“My PhD at MIT Media Lab has been the design and build of a next generation powered prosthesis. The bionic ankle, named TF8, was designed to provide biologically equivalent power and range of motion for plantarflexion-dorsiflexion. This video shows the process of going from a blank sheet of paper to people walking on it. Shown are three different people wearing the robot. About a dozen people have since been able to test the hardware”.
