Here is some data for those of you interested in how the newsletter was doing in the last 3 months!

## Email Subscribers

The growth rate of e-mail subscribers had slowed down quite a bit compared to last year's: we've started the year with 1357 subscribers and we've finished the quarter with 1494 people on board. My spreadsheet says it's 10% growth.

## Website Traffic

The reported web traffic was down by about 27.5%. One probable cause of this is that the newsletter stopped appearing in Google Discovery.

## Time Spent on the Newsletter

I've spent in total over 71 hours on the newsletter this quarter. This is not too far from the previous quarter's 76:32 hours.

## Highlights of the Quarter

What I was really hoping to achieve this first quarter was to record another podcast episode. I had a pretty good line up that was crushed by the whole COVID-19 situation. The virus actually brought a tiny bit of freshness to the newsletter - as you might have seen I've started a Job Seekers section where roboticists looking for work can share their profile with the rest of the community. I'm planning to keep this section on until everything calms down - then I'll most likely switch back to the old careers section.

I'm always juggling with some ideas for this newsletter. Right now what's itching me the most is the design - I'm really really tempted to start a redesign process of both the website and the e-mails. I'll keep you posted on these developments!

Stay safe out there!
