> If you happen to have 22 seconds to spare check out [this tracked robot (?)](https://www.reddit.com/r/robotics/comments/fbrdme/m_wait_for_it_something_really_cool_happens_at/) completing a track with an unexpected twist at the end. Pretty cool, right? After my ask on Twitter and LinkedIn last week the [awesome Weekly Robotics repository] is now at 117 stars! Many thanks to all of you who helped make this project more visible. The most clicked link last week was [Ascento 2 video](https://youtu.be/T6r7EZKZW-E) with 20.9% opens.

1) Super Capacitor Rocket.
<br>[YouTube (Tom Stanton)](https://youtu.be/vWgwYBDSHGo)<br>
INFO: In this video Tom Stanton makes a rocket powered by Super Capacitors and a single motor-propeller combination. I really like the sound this rocket makes as it's climbing up!

2) Atmospheric Satellite.
<br>[GitHub](https://github.com/gusgordon/atmospheric_satellite/blob/master/README.md)<br>
INFO: This repository contains an iPython notebook with the calculations of parameters for a solar plane with minimum wingspan that can indefinitely sustain flight.

3) Mass Layoffs Reported after Starsky Robotics Fails to Find Buyer, Investors.
<br>[Freight Waves](https://www.freightwaves.com/news/exclusive-mass-layoffs-reported-after-starsky-robotics-fails-to-find-buyer-investors)<br>
INFO: "Autonomous trucking startup Starsky Robotics has laid off the majority of its engineers and office personnel after its fundraising efforts and attempts to find a buyer failed, a former executive says".

4) Project MELT: 3D Printer for Space.
<br>[YouTube (ESA)](https://youtu.be/Ps-VubhmnkE)<br>
INFO: This YouTube video showcases a 3D Printer that is said to be ready to print 3D parts in microgravity. You can find a bit more information on Project MELT on [ESA website](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Images/2018/10/MELT_3D_printer). According to [this NASA page](https://www.nasa.gov/content/international-space-station-s-3-d-printer) there was an operational 3D printer already tested on ISS in 2014 and according to [an 2018 article from 3Dprint.com](https://3dprint.com/208144/amf-second-birthday/) there is a commercially available 3D printing service on ISS operated by [Made In Space](https://madeinspace.us/).

5) A Stress Test for Jellyfish.
<br>[Wyss Institute](https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/a-stress-test-for-jellyfish/)<br>
INFO: Researchers had developed a soft robotics manipulator that can help capture very fragile jellyfish without harm and with minimizing stress in these animals. This soft robot is using a hydraulic pump to inflate the fingers with water to cause them to curl.

6) Build A Rover, Send It To The Moon, Sell The Movie Rights: 30 Years of iRobot.
<br>[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/build-rover-send-moon-sell-movie-rights-30-years-irobot-colin-angle/)<br>
INFO: I highly recommend this article to by Colin Angle, a CEO of iRobot, to all robotics entrepreneurs. I found the idea of "Asymmetric Strategic Partnership" an interesting approach to building a robotics company. I also like the story about the 14 failed business models that got iRobot to where they are today.

7) Publication of the Week - Julia for Robotics: Simulation and Real-Time Control in a High-Level Programming Language (2019).
<br>[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331983442_Julia_for_robotics_simulation_and_real-time_control_in_a_high-level_programming_language)<br>
INFO: Many thanks to [Julius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliussust/) for forwarding me this article! This paper describes using [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) to perform a simulation of Atlas and writing modules for low level real-time control and high level control. I found the insights on how the garbage collector affects the execution time in a language like Julia. Interestingly the group managed to execute the control loops in under 2ms with the controller running at 300Hz. You can find the project repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/tkoolen/julia-robotics-paper-code).
