# Intro

Large conferences, where thousands of best and brightest experts and academics gather to share results, findings and insights, are perhaps the most exhilarating and inspiring place to be for an enthusiast of any field. However, as even after any student or IEEE member discounts, attendance to such an event can cost you 500 pounds, not counting accommodation and travel costs. So if the university is paying for you to present, we figured, why not share your impressions with your fellow nerds.


## Macao Venue
It turns out, if you manage to scramble up a paper, even one with little technical content, and a large, respectable conference accepts it - they punish you by having you present it to an audience of actually competent peers. And hence my trip to IROS 2019 hosted at Macao, China, begins.

The conference was hosted at the Venetian Macao Hotel complex. The Taipa Island of Macau seems almost entirely made up of these enormous hotel and entertainment complexes that all connect to one another with underground passages and mimic famous european sites. Unfortunately, as we were travelling east from London, the indoor artificial-sky of the venice canal shopping and food halls, whilst impressive, did not help with our jetlagged internal clocks.

## IROS general

IROS 2019 area was spread across 3 floors for keynote talks, exhibition floor and technical session rooms respectively. Last year in Madrid, IROS took up a whole exhibitions center, but for the Venetrian, the area made up just a corner of a few floors of the hotel.

The conference was time tabled conventionally starting and ending with a day of workshops, with three days of official conference in between. One peculiarity that stuck out was the large number of parallel technical sessions. Tuesday afternoon saw twenty sessions take place at once, so if you wanted to listen in on Grasping III and Computer Vision for Automation I, you could do little but run between the rooms when the current presenter was not to your liking.

The format of technical session was another thing that changed from last year. In 2018, the 90 minutes were used for short 3-5min presentations of papers. Remaining 20-30min was an open floor ‘poster-style’ presentation that allowed people to mingle and have engaged discussions with presenters. This year, the whole session was divided into ‘12 + 3 min’ presentation and questions segments for each individual paper. Personally, as a presenter that put more pressure on me to make a high quality presentation, while as an attendee I found it to be often less engaging and more difficult to focus on.

As the exhibition area was split between multiple rooms, it seemed not as lively as at IROS 2018. However there were still many robots and exciting companies to check out.

Everybody loves a good lab setup, but it’s hard to put that final flourish on when a standard motion capture system can cost you up to 100k. I’ve run into a stand by Nokov that was showcasing their Mars motion capture system. The system tracked grouped retro-reflective markers attached to some small robot platforms. A quick glance over the specs showed that Mars cameras compare to competition quite well for most robotics applications. Frame rate of cameras on offer range from 190 to 340Hz, latency around 3-5ms. Nokov representative assured me that in most cases a Nokov system could cost 50% less compared to Vicon and 20% less compared to Optitrack. So, if you’re setting up a startup with a robotics lab and need to equip your lab with tools necessary to assess SLAM systems, perhaps Nokov is a name you’ve not yet considered.

On the other side of the hall, I’ve had an interesting conversation with a representative from SilverStar. This company was showing off their range of autonomous vacuum cleaners, calling them ‘2nd generation’ in terms of mapping and localization. This new line, is incredibly cheap and hence SilverStar had to develop their own range scanners that were much cheaper as well. The rough specs that I was told, were 8m range, 3% accuracy, 16Hz at around 20 pounds manufacturing cost. These are incredible specs for this price. Unfortunately, the company does not sell these range scanners separately unless in large volumes.

Another company that stuck out to me were AgileX. They are quite young (2017), Shenzhen based startup making small-medium sized rovers as well as other solutions with IP22-64 ratings. They showcased their Scout and Hunter platforms and whilst the specs were similar to products offered by companies like Robotnik or Clearpath, the price points were incredibly low at 5K and 8K respectively. This is quite amazing to see as just a few years ago, robot rovers would cost you around 20K.

Perhaps my most engaging experience was at the stand of [Hebi Robotics](https://www.hebirobotics.com/). Last year, I saw them demonstrate teleoperation of their manipulator using a really intuitive interface based on iphone visual tracking. If you have not read of Hebi before, they develop [highly spec’ed actuators](https://www.hebirobotics.com/r-series-smart-actuators) that are designed to deliver top performance in a plug-and-play fashion.

This year, Hebi had mounted their demo manipulator made of sequentially mounted motor modules on top of a ClearPath platform. They were showing off robustness of their actuators by controlling the robot quite aggressively and using the manipulator to self-right the platform after it would tip over. Stealing candy from the box on top of an AgileX platform added extra few points for cuteness. Hebi also [showed off](https://youtu.be/9gzna0ha1ws) their new rugged and waterproof R-Series modules with IP67 rating. The modules use really sleek fibre optics connectors for their data transport.

However, what left a huge impression was one of the founders (Florian Enner) sharing the contents of his blog. There are a number of interesting posts on there, but “[A Practical Look at Latency in Robotics : The Importance of Metrics and Operating Systems](https://ennerf.github.io/2016/09/20/A-Practical-Look-at-Latency-in-Robotics-The-Importance-of-Metrics-and-Operating-Systems.html)” and ”[Analyzing the viability of Ethernet and UDP for robot control](https://ennerf.github.io/2016/11/23/Analyzing-the-viability-of-Ethernet-and-UDP-for-robot-control.html)” are just amazing. He makes a deep dive into latency and robustness of UDP network setups with different OSs and topology. Its really interesting and useful for anyone who is looking to do reliable high frequency control over ethernet.

After going through all the leaflets I’ve accumulated over the conference, I noticed something peculiar - [ROS Cube](https://www.adlinktech.com/Products/ROS2_Solution/ROS2_Controller/ROScube-I#tab-ordering
). I have no memory of this stand, but it turns out, ADLink had a cool idea of a ROS 2-enabled robotic controllers as an off the shelf product.

This unassuming stand left one of the largest impressions on me. [Motiv robotics](http://www.motivrobotics.com/) is a [modular actuator company](http://www.motivrobotics.com/products#/products/manipulators) similar to Hebi. However the shape/size/intent is slightly different. They aim for modular mobile (wheel or legged) manipulators, hence the cylindrical design with multiple degree of freedom.

The reason I was struck were the specifications of their singly manipulator MANTIS ! Their weight to payload ratio is almost 1:1, their payload is 20kg ! (27 on their website!) At this time, to my understanding, these kind of specifications can only be found on a heavy, industrial robot. So seeing it a human-scale with intent for mobile manipulation is surreal. However, this comes at a price… The representative at the stand gave a rough price range of a legged manipulator setup being at 750K range.

Further - the company is big on the modular design idea. Their manipulators are designed to construct a large any-configuration robot, that is one of their selling points.
They treat wheels as end-effectors, again, illustrating modular paradigm.

Their control loop runs at 250Hz, they can do in-field replacement of limbs and overall the robot looks really sleek. However, I was told they only have one robot built as the company is very new.

Last year at IROS there were only two companies promoting their quadruped platforms. This year, this number grew and there were at least 4 or 5 quadrupeds running around in the exhibition area. My ‘educated’ opinion is that quadrupeds will soon (1-3 year range) dominate the market for robotics. Hence I think it’s important to familiarise and understand the specs of quadrupeds currently on the market.

Of course, Anymal, an ETH Zurich spinoff platform (very high price-range and, from my understanding, not really commercial yet) was presenting at IROS, however UniTree were the ones dominating through quantity and, seemingly, market readiness. They demonstrated two of their platforms of different sizes. AlienGo - a smaller quadruped at around 20k price point and [LaikaGo](http://www.unitree.cc/e/action/ShowInfo.php?classid=6&id=1), a bigger brother of AlienGo.

Interestingly, MIT lab responsible for Cheetah demonstrated their 9kg [Cheetah minis](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-7665923/MIT-shows-virtually-indestructible-mini-cheetah-robots-new-video.html). The keynote speaker even mentioned that every grad student in their lab are given access to one.

Just to bring attention to a London based quadruped company, I recently saw that [ZAO robotics](https://www.zoarobotics.com/) have begun advertising their platform online.

A rather enormous stand was showcasing the progress of [MBZIRC Robotics Competition](http://www.mbzirc.com/challenge/2020). This is an advanced robotics competition with contestants from top robotics labs across the world. At this stage, I’d recommend checking out the media outcome from their websites and the progress reports [available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=mbzirc+2020). It is impressive to see what these teams are up to.

As I’m personally most interesting in construction robotics, I was incredibly glad to see that this year at IROS Robotics in Construction had its own session with some overwhelmingly impressive papers. As it is quite a niche area, I’ll just recommend, for anyone interested, to check out papers bny ETH Zurich on motion of walking excavators and end-effector localization (down to few mm) in a construction site.

And finally, to end this impressions post, I’ll just add that : After long, jetlagged days of checking out robots and being intimidated and simultaneously impressed and excited by the work of people in your field, there is nothing better than to lose some money in Macao casinos. Honestly, I got 12,13 and 14 in a row. Hit every time and burnt every time. This is ridiculous! Well, at least I managed some great pics of the non-hotel part of the island.
