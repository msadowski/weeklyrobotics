> If you can't have enough of Holiday robot videos then [Robohub has you covered](https://robohub.org/holiday-robot-videos-2020/). Since I have your attention now, I would like to use this opportunity to wish you Happy New Year! May it be at least slightly better than the last one. The most clicked link last week was [the repository with GeRoNa](https://github.com/cogsys-tuebingen/gerona), a modular robot navigation framework, with 13.1% opens.

#### Ten Robot Mechanisms For Your Design Toolbox

{:.post-source}
[Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/12/25/ten-robot-mechanisms-for-your-design-toolbox/)

Paul Gould has been experimenting with some interesting mechanical designs for robotics and is planning to open source at least a couple of them. In the attached video you will find some capstan drives, actuators for quadrupeds, GUS Simpson Drive, cycloidal gearboxes, a claw arcade robot. Very cool!

#### Robot Fails From an Escalator

I could not find any more information on this event except from the video which shows a robot driving onto an escalator and subsequently falling and hitting two people. I couldn't find any more information about this accident but given that someone was filming it (and possibly obstructing the path of the robot) I expect that there might have been some level of malice involved. Still, this kind of robot should need some safety features that would prevent an accident like this happening.

A very good article from Clearpath on the right questions to ask before deciding on a custom robotics platform.

I've come across this project on [ROS-Agriculture](https://github.com/ros-agriculture) Slack channel. It's a wiki covering a wide range of topics related to Robotics. [The project repository](https://github.com/RoboticsKnowledgebase/roboticsknowledgebase.github.io/) seems to be very active.

#### DIY Hobby Servos Quadruped Robot

CHOP is an interesting quadruped robot project that's supposedly < $400 in parts to make. The video at the top of the page is super funny and shows some of the capabilities of the robot such as firefighting and pulling a cart with bananas.

#### Publication of the Week - LAURON V: A Versatile Six-Legged Walking Robot with Advanced Maneuverability (2014)

[ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/263740139_LAURON_V_A_Versatile_Six-Legged_Walking_Robot_with_Advanced_Maneuverability)

Last week I've promised I would do some research on the multilegged robot featured in the FZI Christmas Video. Apparently, it's called Lauron V (thanks Atul!). The 6-legged robot weights 42 kg and has a footprint of 0.9 x 0.8m. Apparently having 6 legs can be useful as you can attach a gripper to one of the joint and teach the robot to pick objects and store it on its back. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAURON) has a neat history of the platform, with the first iteration of the robot dating back to 1994.

### Weekly Robotics 2 Years Ago

{:.post-source}
[Issue 19](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-19)

Right around this time 2 years ago [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/) simulator went [open source](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/blog/Webots-2019-a-release). From what I've heard Webots has a pretty good [ROS2 Interface nowadays](http://wiki.ros.org/webots_ros2).

The next interesting project featured in the newsletter back then is [HAMR-E](https://wyss.harvard.edu/news/robots-with-sticky-feet-can-climb-up-down-and-all-around/), a tiny legged robot using electro-adhesion to climb surfaces. A new version of the robot from HAMR family was announced earlier this year and is called [HAMR-JR](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/news/2020/06/next-generation-cockroach-inspired-robot-small-mighty) ([WR #94](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-94)), which is a scaled-down version of HAMR, but without electro-adhesion pads.

We've also learned about a new instance of robots being used for good: [a robot delivering baby corals](https://robohub.org/robot-makes-world-first-baby-coral-delivery-to-great-barrier-reef/) to the Great Barrier Reef. Even though the linked article mentions plans to scale up the project further in 2019 I could not find any other information on the project besides 2018 reports and a [donation page](https://www.qut.edu.au/engage/giving/support-research/great-barrier-reef).

Finally, we were looking at the [foldable drone](http://rpg.ifi.uzh.ch/docs/RAL18_Falanga.pdf) from the Researchers from UZH and EPFL. A neat example of how changing the shape of a drone affects the flight characteristics.
