> Last week, exactly 800 days after the first issue of Weekly Robotics, the newsletter had hit [2,000 e-mail subscribers](https://twitter.com/WeeklyRobotics/status/1321412016381317123). Many thanks to all of you enjoying WR! If you know anyone who might like the newsletter I would appreciate it if you could forward it to them. On another note, [October issue](https://www.patreon.com/posts/monthly-robotics-43399619) of Monthly Robotics, a handpicked highlights from the past 4 newsletter issues is out for the newsletter supporters! The most clicked link last week was [the Jetson based R/C robot car project](https://hackaday.io/project/175387-jetson-nano-robot-realsense-rplidar-joysticks) with 13.7% opens.

IROS 2020 wrapped up, hence I expect lots of interesting projects to make their way to the newsletter. In this one, the researchers from CUHK-Shenzhen developed swarm robots called FreeBOTs. The robots are inside a steel sphere, each containing two motors and a magnet.

[Engadget](https://www.engadget.com/roborace-self-driving-race-car-drives-into-wall-142758048.html)

A Roborace team, [SIT Autonomous](https://sit.org/sit-autonomous), recently had their autonomous car crash into the wall during a competition ((Twitch link)[https://clips.twitch.tv/ColdbloodedCredulousTriangleArsonNoSexy]). According to [this follow-up article](https://www.engadget.com/roborace-driverless-racecar-crash-155547270.html), the source of the problem was a locked steering wheel. Autonomous cars are hard!

How realistic can an animatronic gaze be? It turns out it can be uncannily realistic. For more information about this research, you can check out [Disney Research website](https://la.disneyresearch.com/publication/realistic-and-interactive-robot-gaze/).

#### Robot Dolphin – Which Could Be the End of Captive Animals at Theme Parks

While we are on the topic of animatronics; check out this animatronic Dolphin by [Edge Innovations](https://www.edgefx.com/). This 2.5m long, 250kg robot covered in medical-grade silicone is surprisingly life-like, which should be expected given the price ($26M).

"Roboats" are in the news again! You might have seen this project mentioned in this newsletter in the [issue #54](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-54), over 1 year ago. Since then the Roboat doubled in size, weighing around 50 kilogrammes, and is sporting navigation algorithms that utilize SLAM, GPS and IMU.

AgRob_PP is a set of three ROS based tools for agricultural robotics:
1. AgRob Vineyards Detector - a satellite image segmentation tool
2. AgRob Topologic - a tool to construct a topological map
3. AgRob Path Planning - A path planning framework for uneven terrains

released under GPLv3 licence. In the repository, you will find a video presenting this package.

Researchers at EPFL had been developing a fixed-wing with morphing wing architecture to alter flight characteristics of the aircraft mid-flight. Neat concept!
