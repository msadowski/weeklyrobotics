1) Drones Used to Find Toylike Butterfly Land Mines.
<br>[Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/drones-used-to-find-toylike-butterfly-land-mines/)<br>
INFO: Researchers at Binghamton University in New York are using thermal imagery captured by a multirotor UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) to search for landmines. In the trials the team was able to pick up about 78% of the mines.

2) Self-driving Rovers Tested in Mars Like Morocco.
<br>[ESA](http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Engineering_Technology/Self-driving_rovers_tested_in_Mars-like_Morocco)<br>
INFO: Recently ESA coordinated self-driving space rover trials in Sahara desert. Before testing of the rovers ESA mapped the test location using a drone, producing a digital elevation model with a 4cm resolution that were used as a ground truth to the data captured by the rovers. The article mentions that SherpaTT rover managed a 1.3 km journey during trials.

3) Cafe Staffed by Robots Controlled by Paralyzed People.
<br>[SoraNews24](https://soranews24.com/2018/11/29/cafe-opens-in-tokyo-staffed-by-robots-controlled-by-paralyzed-people/)<br>
INFO: On November 26th a ribbon cutting ceremony was held at Dawn ver.β Cafe that was meant to be a trial run that lasted until 7th of December 2018. According to the linked article the Cafe used OriHime-D robots that paralyzed people could control from their homes. The project was crowdfunded and if the support continues it is hoped that the full fledged Dawn Cafe can open in 2020.

4) Autodrome: OpenAI Gym environment for self-driving vehicle development.
<br>[Autodrome](https://github.com/vojtamolda/autodrome/wiki)<br>
INFO: The simulator is built around the engine, map editor and assets of Euro Truck Simulator 2 or American Truck Simulator. The project is released under MIT Licence.

5) The Disruptors Podcast Episode on Bio Inspired Robotics.
<br>[The Disruptors](https://disruptors.fm/69-bio-inspired-robotics-drones-on-battlefield-and-building-realworld-c3po-auke-ijspeert/)<br>
INFO: In this podcast episode Prof. Auke Ijspeert from EPFL (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne) discussing biology vs mechanics. In the interview Prof. Ijspeert provides quite an interesting view on Boston Dynamics and Academia. Other topics covered in the Podcast are military use of robots, exoskeletons, [Uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) (including a robotic crocodille), robotics and jobs.

6) Project Soli.
<br>[Project Soli](https://atap.google.com/soli/)<br>
INFO: Google is working on a 8x10mm radar chip for gesture detection. The radar operates at 60 GHz ISM band. According to the information on the website the SDK can provide data at 100 to 10,000 frames per second.

7) Publication of the week - Excalve: Hardware Testing in Mass Production, Made Easier (2018).
<br>[bunnie:studios](https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=5450)<br>
INFO: This blog post about hardware testing is made of two parts. The first one talks about test jigs and automated hardware/firmware testing of electronics. The second part introduces Exclave - a factory test infrastructure written in Rust. We found the post to be very informative and full of good practices for electronics mass production.
