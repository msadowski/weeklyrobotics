> Not really Robotics related but I thoroughly enjoyed [this episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqidD7kVnxY) of Smarter Everyday on Supersonic Baseball Cannon. It is some very good engineering and a very nice build montage! In one of the [Patreon updates](https://www.patreon.com/posts/slack-access-for-40841660) I've mentioned that I would give away access to Weekly Robotics Slack for the first 15 supporters, regardless of their pledge - there is still a chance for 4 readers to get on board by sponsoring me a single coffee a month. The most clicked last week was [Freedom Robotics guide for tuning wheel odometry](https://www.freedomrobotics.ai/blog/tuning-odometry-for-wheeled-robots) with 14.7% opens.

I recently came across this video from 2013 showing Lemur IIB robot equipped with micro claws that allow it to firmly attach to rocks. If you have been following this newsletter for some time you might remember this design from [this short documentary](https://youtu.be/q2SKa9IEG4M) that appeared in the [issue 48](https://weeklyrobotics.com/weekly-robotics-48).

#### The US Army Spent Millions Developing Giant, Six-Legged Walking Trucks in the 1980s

{:.post-source}
[The Drive](https://www.thedrive.com/news/36157/the-us-army-spent-millions-developing-giant-six-legged-walking-trucks-in-the-1980s)

In 1980 US Army partnered with Ohio State University to develop this six-legged hydraulic walking robot called "Adaptive Suspension Vehicle". The machine used an array of 17 computers to handle 150k lines of code written in Pascal (!). The maximum speed of this robot was 8 mph (~13 km/h) - quite good for a machine weighing 6k pounds (2.7k kg).

[Skynet Today](https://www.skynettoday.com/overviews/killer-robots)

While we are on the subject of military robots this article by Bryan McMahon provides a good overview on the current state of LAWS (Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems), the countries that develop them and the legal aspect of them.

#### Biohybrid Design: How to Build a Biological Robot

{:.post-source}
[Science Focus](https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/biohybrid-design-how-to-build-a-biological-robot/)

This is an interview with a dr Ritu Raman, who works on making robots from biological materials that could be used to create actuators that could then be used in a human body.

#### PufferBot: Actuated Expandable Structures for Aerial Robots

{:.post-source}
[YouTube](https://youtu.be/XtPepCxWcBg)

"We present PufferBot, an aerial robot with an expandable structure that may expand to protect a drone's propellers when the robot is close to obstacles or collocated humans. PufferBot is made of a custom 3D-printed expandable scissor structure, which utilizes a one degree of freedom actuator with rack and pinion mechanism. We propose four designs for the expandable structure, each with unique characterizations for different situations. Finally, we present three motivating scenarios in which PufferBot may extend the utility of existing static propeller guard structures". You can find the preprint describing the invention on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.07615).
